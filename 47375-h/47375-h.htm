<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The End of the Day.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_339.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">All Saints' Day</span> was near.
It was very cold. At five
o'clock, night came. Marianne
has risen slowly from her seat
and gone to close the window,
which she had opened for a
few minutes to let some fresh air into the
room. Ah! how dark and cheerless is the
weather! On the pavements it must be
difficult to walk, so thickly coated are they
with slippery mud&mdash;mud that is everywhere,
mud and standing puddles. A hard winter
is commencing. The charcoal seller will
want a great deal of money.</p>

<p>Ah, well&mdash;that is an expense that has been
foreseen. The charcoal man and the baker
have to be paid; and with courage and health
it can be done.</p>

<p>In spite of the hissing wind and the biting
cold, Marianne rested on her elbows at the
open window for a moment; it refreshed her
head. She was so tired. Since the morning
she had hardly quitted her work, and sewing
is so wearisome. Four children, the two
eldest at school, the third at the asylum; the
fourth, still quite young, in its white-curtained
cradle.</p>

<p>The needle must be kept stitching, stitching,
there must be no going to sleep over
the work; but both ends could be made to
meet, and that is the chief thing. Jacques
Houdaille is a good workman, thirty-seven
years of age, with a solid backbone, as he
says. He works his full time; skulking is
not in his way, he leaves that to fellows with
hay in their sabots; he has youngsters, and
they must be fed&mdash;that's all he knows.
Besides, the missis has her notions: she is
proud of herself, she'd not have any debts in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Poor Jacques! he had not always been so
reasonable, and there was a time when his
life had not been so well led.</p>

<p>Marianne, feeling the cold, which raised
the handkerchief covering her shoulders and
pierced beneath her dress, shut the window
and moved about the room, putting things in
order, then, after lighting her lamp, resumed
her place near the stove.</p>

<p>The work she was doing was wanted
speedily, and she wished to finish it. It was
Saturday, and there is so much to be done
on Sunday, where there is a workman's
clothes to be mended and a family of young
children to be tended.</p>

<p>But while plying the needle she reflected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 479px;">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="479" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"MARIANNE SHUT THE WINDOW."</p></div>
</div>

<p>No, it was a fact, her Jacques had not
always reasoned so justly. It was not that he
was naturally fickle; he was an honest, hard-working
man, a good workman at his trade,
open-hearted, devoted to his wife, whom he
had married for love, and adoring his children.
But he was feeble-minded, ignorant, fond
of listening to glib talkers, phrasemongers,
and unable to refuse the offer of a glass;
and, one glass drunk, a second followed, and
at the third he lost his head, and gave himself
up to a drinking bout.</p>

<p>Ah! Marianne had not laughed every day
at that time, and that had not been all. In
those days Jacques sometimes only brought
home from five-and-twenty to thirty francs a
week: that was not a sum on which they
could live; lodgings cost dear, and Marianne,
who was still young, liked to dress as well as
other people.</p>

<p>Then poverty came, the man was out of
heart, and, during several months, did no
work. That was anything but a gay time.</p>

<p>But all that was over. Marianne, as well
as seeing to the home and attending to the
children, made her fifty sous a-day. It was no
great thing, but with Jacques's wages, they
were not badly off; for the blacksmith now
earned from sixty to seventy francs a week&mdash;nine
and ten francs a day and overtime, for
which he was paid double. It was not much
to talk of, but the workmen had
had nothing to complain about
for some length of time. Certainly,
as Jacques said, there was
still a good deal to be done;
there was still wanting insurance
against want of employment, accidents,
and the infirmities of age.
But everything could not be done
at once, and Jacques did not
grumble; he hoped it would all
come right in time. He was a
philosopher.</p>

<p>They were living then in a
very small town, where the population
was not large. But the
proprietors of the factory where
he worked were good men, who
understood that men must be enabled
to live by their labour, and
that the price of everything was
high. They even talked of one day
giving the factory hands a share
in the profits of the enterprise.</p>

<p>"That's only a dream," said
Jacques Houdaille. "There's
amongst us a pack of idlers
and incompetents, who don't earn
even the wages they get now; and then the
workman knows nothing about account-keeping,
and likes to see his way clearly; I
only know what I am paid."</p>

<p>Marianne laughed as she thought of her
husband's rough way of speaking.</p>

<p>What more could be expected of him?
He hammered iron all day, swinging heavy
sledge-hammers, bare-armed, in the red light
of the forge. That kind of work did not
give him polite manners, but he was so
kind-hearted, and could express himself so
tenderly when he chose: so long as he
kept from drink; and he had refrained
already for several months.</p>

<p>And Marianne, as she cast her eyes about
her, felt a thrill of happiness. She was in
her own home, and everything in it had
been gained without owing a sou to anybody:
the neat furniture, a handsome, brightly
polished commode with its marble top, and
on the mantelpiece a large gilt clock, "warranted
for two years." It was comfort, almost
ease! Oh, if it would only last for ever!
And why should it not?</p>

<p>Seven o'clock struck.</p>

<p>"Heavens! I must see to my dinner!"</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Evening Meal.</span></h3>

<p>She sprang up from her seat, hurried to the
kitchen, stirred up the fire, then returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
the little sitting-room, cleared the table, and
set out the dinner things.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 614px;">
<img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="614" height="529" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE HAMMERED IRON ALL DAY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the street below heavy clattering steps
were heard upon the pavement: it was the
work-people going home. Some slouched
along, with their hands in their pockets,
scenting the wide-open cabaret; others
quickened their pace, eager to get back to
their firesides, to the kind faces of their
housewives and their shock-headed children.</p>

<p>The door opened abruptly; it was he, tall,
strong, all black&mdash;a handsome man under his
rough skin and bushy beard. The children,
who had waited for his coming out of
the factory, were with him. They seated
themselves at table and Marianne brought in
the soup.</p>

<p>The blacksmith was fond of soup, fond of
the good odour which escaped from the
brown tureen; and he proved it by having
his plate filled three times to the brim.</p>

<p>Yet he did not look in a good temper.
His clear blue eyes flashed under his knit
brows, and it was with rough gesture he
emptied the glass of wine Marianne had
taken pleasure in pouring out for him.</p>

<p>"This state of things can't go on much
longer," he said, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Marianne,
anxiously. "Haven't you been paid your
wages?"</p>

<p>"Thunder! It only wants to come to
that. If ever they don't pay me, I'll burn
down the whole shop!"</p>

<p>"How strange you are to-night! What is
the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Well, never you
mind; women have nothing to do with such
things."</p>

<p>"Give me your money, Jacques," said
Marianne, speaking softly, thinking that he
had forgotten himself a little on leaving the
factory, and that it was well to take precautions.</p>

<p>"My money&mdash;what for?"</p>

<p>"For one reason, because you have no
need to keep it in your pocket&mdash;you may
lose it."</p>

<p>"Or drink it away, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well! then you know what I have to
pay, that I owe for my last confinement to
the doctor, and the tailor has called&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tailor! You are tricking me out
nicely! Monsieur must have his tailor, now,
like a fund-holder. And a doctor is to be
paid by a workman&mdash;there's another good-for-nothing
to be put down!"</p>

<p>The blacksmith seized the bottle of wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
that was within his reach and refilled his
glass.</p>

<p>"Jacques," said Marianne, now become
slightly pale, "what is the matter with you
to-day? I have never seen you like this
before."</p>

<p>"I have had enough of this sort of life; it
is time to end it, and that we should know a
little whether it is not the man who makes
the harvest that is to eat the corn."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Marianne, "I was sure you
had been drinking."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, but that's neither here nor
there. I tell you that at the factory we've had
enough of sweating, and have revolted at last."</p>

<p>"Jacques," cried Marianne, trembling,
"has any injustice been done to you?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing else but injustice in this
world. For whom do we slave? For whom
do we toil the life out of us? For the rich
and idle! I tell you, you are not going to
pay for anything more with my money; I
shall want it for myself, for I am not going
back to work again."</p>

<p>He rose, snatched up his cap and planted
it on his head.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Jacques?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i_342.jpg" width="437" height="595" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WHERE ARE YOU GOING, JACQUES?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"To join the comrades who are waiting
for me. If I don't come back to-night,
you'll know."</p>

<p>Marianne brushed away a tear which was
running down her cheek, and tried to put a
cheerful face on the matter. The children
were there, and she did not want them to
comprehend that anything serious was occurring.
Perhaps, too&mdash;who could tell?&mdash;there
might really be nothing in it; men are so
foolish when they have been drinking.</p>

<p>"He has been put out in some way," she
said to herself; "it has mounted to his head,
and he is going to give way a little this evening,
to drown his irritation, which will be gone
to-morrow."</p>

<p>She put her children to bed, cleared away
the dinner things, and resumed her sewing.
But, in spite of herself, she could not help
recalling what her husband had said. Why
this hatred against the classes above him?
What had they done to him? M. Hennetier,
the principal proprietor of the factory, was a
moderately rich man; but, down to the present
time, the workmen in his employ had always
regarded him as both good and just in his
dealings with them. To make everybody as
well off as himself was impossible.
The position he held had been
won by hard work; for he had
once been a foreman only in the
establishment of which he was
now at the head.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Strike.</span></h3>

<p>Jacques returned late in the night.
He was not drunk, as Marianne
feared he would be; but he was
highly excited and talked of nothing
less than setting fire to the
factory they had quitted the evening
before.</p>

<p>Next day he was no calmer.
He was hardly at home all day.
In the evening, Marianne, looking
out of window, saw that something
was in the air. The workmen
were gathered in knots in
the street, or walking about and
talking together excitedly. On the
following day Jacques did what
he had never before done, made
"Saint Monday." On Tuesday
he returned to the factory, but it
was with all the pains in the world
and with prayers and tears that
Marianne was able to induce him
to do so.</p>

<p>"We are going to keep on till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the end of the week," he said, when he
returned home at night. And, sure enough,
on Friday night he came back with a
triumphant air, and threw his bag of tools
into a corner of the room.</p>

<p>"It's done!" he said.</p>

<p>"What is done?" cried Marianne, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"The factory, from to-night, is picketed."</p>

<p>"Picketed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, every hand forbidden to enter it:
the first of ours who enters the gates will be
a dead man!"</p>

<p>"By what right?"</p>

<p>"Because we've come out on strike!"</p>

<p>"On strike!" repeated Marianne, shuddering
at that terrific word. "Then you are not
going to work&mdash;will have no more wages to
receive; but what is to become of us, then?
How are we to live?"</p>

<p>"Oh! don't worry yourself about that,"
replied the blacksmith, feeling a little uneasy
in spite of his words; "we have funds, we
shall all get two francs a day."</p>

<p>"Two francs&mdash;and four children!"</p>

<p>"You have some savings?"</p>

<p>"And when they are gone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother me!&mdash;so long as the
workman gets his rights. We've had enough
of this miserable existence."</p>

<p>"Miserable on what you have been earning?"
said Marianne. "Look about you. In
this very house, on the first floor, there is a
family: the husband alone works, and has a
salary of only eighteen hundred francs a year."</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> eighteen hundred!"</p>

<p>"That's five francs a day, and you earn
double that."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is so&mdash;when you count
it up."</p>

<p>"Well, these people have three children,
and when they go out they are dressed like
princes."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they don't eat."</p>

<p>"You mean they don't <i>drink</i>. Well, they
find the means for going out on Sundays, for
going once or twice a year to the theatre, to
receive friends&mdash;in short, they appear to be
at ease, and make no complaint as to their
condition."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the blacksmith, bringing
down his clenched fist heavily on the table,
"do you compare me with a paper-scratcher?
Are such things as him men at all? He has
not even a trade! A paper-scratcher!&mdash;a
pack of useless idlers the whole lot of them&mdash;as
bad as tradesmen and the rest of the
bloodsuckers!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 620px;">
<img src="images/i_343.jpg" width="620" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"AT THE CABARET."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Marianne saw that he had no other answer
to give. For some time he was no longer
himself. He did not get exactly drunk, but
he was constantly in a state that was half-way
towards intoxication, and a mere nothing
roused his anger. It was still worse some
days later, and if the wife was resigned, the
mother asked herself in terror, whether it
was possible for her to continue to live with
him. He did no work, and his days were
spent at the cabaret, sometimes part of his
nights. He, formerly so kind and tender to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
his wife, regarded her with nothing but
savage looks; and as to his children, of
whom he had been so fond, he ceased to
notice them even.</p>

<p>Marianne cried when she was alone, for it
was the future which, more than all, terrified
her. There was no more money coming in,
and her little savings, so painfully amassed,
were, day by day, dwindling. She had been
obliged to sell a railway share, a tiny piece
of paper of which she had been so proud.
Linen, clothes, all took the same road; the
handsome gilt clock had to be sold, the
commode&mdash;even the children's playthings
and books, one day, when they were hungry.</p>

<p>It must be told, too, that she herself earned
nothing. Not only had work been brought to
a standstill since the outset of that detestable
strike: people who had, before that, employed
her, now shut their doors in her face.</p>

<p>"We don't give work to the wife of a
striker," they said.</p>

<p>She had swallowed her tears and had felt
a movement of anger. Was it her fault that
it had happened? More than all, was it the
fault of her poor little ones, who, if the present
state of things continued, would become
destitute? No; but it was a contest&mdash;war
between classes. What a frightful
misfortune that men could
not come to an understanding
and help, rather than hate and
fight, each other!</p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Seditious Placards.</span></h3>

<p>One evening Jacques slunk
like a thief up the stairs of his
house and entered his room
furtively. He was pale, his face
contorted, his eyes haggard;
and it was with a panting
voice he called Marianne.</p>

<p>"I am pursued," he said;
"I have come to let you know
and to share what money you
have&mdash;for I must escape."</p>

<p>She threw herself upon his
neck.</p>

<p>"What is it you have done?"</p>

<p>"Oh! a mere nothing:
posted up some bills on the
walls; they say these placards
are seditious."</p>

<p>"And you are being pursued?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are trying to
arrest me. I'm not afraid of
a prison, but I don't fancy being
made to pay for others."</p>

<p>"Yet that is all you will do,
Jacques; for you are weak-minded, and allow
yourself to be led away."</p>

<p>"They say it is revolutionary."</p>

<p>"Yes, and they will make an insurgent of
you. They will push you on to fight behind
a barricade; they will get themselves made
Deputies or Ministers, and leave you to be
put in irons and sent to die five thousand
leagues away, if you are not shot against a
wall. It is wrong of you, Jacques, to have
allowed yourself to be led into this position;
women see further than you&mdash;because they
are mothers."</p>

<p>All the while she was weeping and talking
she was hurriedly making up a bundle of
clothes. Then kissing Jacques&mdash;holding
him in a long embrace&mdash;she placed two five-franc
pieces in his hand, perhaps the only
two left in the house.</p>

<p>"Don't go yet," she said; "I want you
to see the children."</p>

<p>But sounds were heard on the stairs&mdash;the
whisperings of men stealthily ascending.</p>

<p>"The police!" cried Houdaille. "Oh,
the brutes!&mdash;Adieu! I have no time to
lose. Don't be afraid&mdash;they won't take me!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i_344.jpg" width="491" height="592" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"STRIKING OUT WITH HIS FISTS,"</p></div>
</div>

<p>He opened the door suddenly and darted
down the stairs, striking out with his fists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and with such whirling rapidity, that the poor
fellows in pursuit of him had nothing but their
pains for their labour in the long and fruitless
chase which followed.</p>

<p>Marianne breathed again&mdash;he was saved.
Saved, yes&mdash;but what was to become of
him?</p>

<p>During the greater part of the night she
stood with her face pressing the windowpane,
shuddering at the slightest sound made
without, expecting every moment to see him
re-appear. For an instant a cold perspiration
burst out upon her forehead; it was a troop
of soldiers, a whole battalion of infantry, the
commander at its head, passing under her
windows, and when the sound of their feet
had died away into the icy silence of the
night, it was the turn of cavalry, the iron
hoofs of the horses clattering upon the
frosted pavement in the moonlight. It was
part of a regiment of dragoons, with down-bent
heads, enveloped in their grey cloaks
and sabre in hand.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Gleam of Gaiety.</span></h3>

<p>Three weeks passed after that, and the strike
still continued&mdash;the strike&mdash;that is to say,
the ruin of the country, discomfort to the
rich, misery to the poor, excitement amongst
the masses, alarm everywhere.</p>

<p>Jacques Houdaille had not reappeared.
He knew that a warrant for his arrest was
out against him, and he was not so stupid
as to come and throw himself into the wolf's
jaws.</p>

<p>Several of his comrades had been arrested
and were awaiting their trial. What would
become of them? Poor fellows! They
still held up their heads behind the bars of
their prison.</p>

<p>Their counsel, a tall, thin man, who wished
to fatten himself and become a somebody at
the Bar, excited them in their bravado. He
quite well knew what he was about, that glib
speaker; in any case, it was they, poor
creatures, who would pay for the broken
pottery.</p>

<p>Jacques Houdaille, more fortunate, was
still at liberty. But where was he? How
would he escape? Marianne had heard
no news of him, and while awaiting the end
of all those misfortunes, she had to live, and
that was hard to do&mdash;nothing left, and four
mouths to feed.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;for a fortnight past, at least&mdash;she
had obtained work. Some persons had
had pity on her, and had promised to do
something for her children. It had come to be
recognised that neither she nor her little ones
were responsible for the faults of the wretched
husband.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th December
some of these charitably-disposed persons
had gone to see her. The next day
was a day of rest, and, on the occasion
of the Christmas holidays, had brought
for her children new and warm winter
clothing.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated to accept
these presents, for all her life she had been
able to buy for herself all she needed, and
had never held out her hand. But she was
made to see that it was not on her own
account this assistance was being offered
to her&mdash;that, in any case, she was in an
exceptional position&mdash;that her husband
had left her and was not likely soon to
return to her; and that it would be, on
her part, an act of unjustifiable pride to
condemn her children to suffer, when it
was impossible for her to provide for their
needs. She gave in to those good reasons,
and her children were loud in the expression
of their delight.</p>

<p>"That is not all," said one of her visitors.
"At Madame Hennetier's, this evening, there
is to be an assemblage of thirty children
belonging to our town; they are to keep
Christmas, and you must promise us to bring
your little ones."</p>

<p>Marianne became very pale.</p>

<p>"Madame Hennetier!" she said; "but
she is the wife of the principal manager of
the factory where my husband worked!"</p>

<p>"Madame Hennetier knows that, and
wishes to give you a proof of her esteem.
Efforts are, at this moment, being made to
bring the workmen back from the misguided
step they have taken; there is no concession
which the masters are not prepared to grant,
in the hope of putting an end to this horrible
strike, for everybody plainly sees that if the
situation is continued it will result in a great
disaster. But, in this matter of the children's
Christmas treat, there is no question of
politics. Christmas begins to-night; there is,
we know only too well, much poverty in
the country; in more than one garret
to-night there will be no supper, and to-morrow
will find many empty stomachs
and many little shoes unvisited in the
night by Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"Madame Hennetier and her sister
have both been poor; they know what it
is to want bread, and do not blush
to have it known. They have remained
good in their relative prosperity, and they
have resolved to give, this evening, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
hours of happy forgetfulness to the poor
innocent little ones about them."</p>

<p>Marianne still shrank from making the
surrender asked of her, for many thoughts
had crowded upon her mind while her visitor
was speaking. She said to herself: "My
husband would refuse; to him these people
are enemies. Yet&mdash;why enemies?" she
reflected; "they appear, on the contrary, to
be animated by the best feelings towards
him, and to have but one purpose&mdash;to bring
him back to calmness and reason."</p>

<p>Then the children were present, listening
anxiously; there would be a beautiful supper,
sweetmeats, cakes, a profusion of playthings.
For days past, nothing else had been talked
of in the place but this entertainment.
They had been thinking of it, not dreaming
that they would be invited to it.</p>

<p>At last Marianne made up her mind.</p>

<p>"What can I give them instead?&mdash;nothing.
I have no right to deprive them of this happiness."
And aloud she replied: "I will
come, madame."</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands.</p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pity!</span></h3>

<p>The little f&ecirc;te was brilliant and tumultuous.
More than forty children were gathered about
an immense table laden with flowers and food
of all kinds: smoking puddings; geese, stuffed
with chestnuts, and roasted to the hue
of gold; pastry
and ornamented
sweets; and hillocks
of comfits
and lozenges. But
what were more
beautiful still, were
ten Christmas
trees, in all their
wealth of green,
hung with a thousand
playthings of
all forms and
colours.</p>

<p>Marianne and
her four children
arrived rather late;
but as soon as
she appeared a
place was made
for her. A quarter
of an hour later
she would have
found it difficult
to single out the
elder ones, they
were so completely
mixed with the joyous crowd. A little
before midnight, Marianne rose and her eyes
searched for her truants. She was instantly
surrounded.</p>

<p>"You are not going to take them away
from us?"</p>

<p>"It is getting late, and to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow is a holiday, and to-night you
belong to us; besides, the playthings will
not be distributed before one o'clock, and
you would not like your children not to have
their share."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Marianne, "I will let
the two elder ones stay and leave the third
in your charge while I go home and put the
youngest to bed. You see he is already
asleep, and my neighbour has promised to
wait for me."</p>

<p>On this engagement she was allowed to
go, and the supper, which was drawing to a
close, was continued with redoubled gaiety,
with bravos and peals of laughter.</p>

<p>In the street Marianne was surprised at
the silence and deep darkness all about her.
She felt at first cold, then afraid, and hurried
on with rapid steps. But she had not gone
many yards before she came to a sudden
standstill: a cloud seemed to pass before her
eyes and a suppressed scream rent her
bosom. She fell back a pace.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 568px;">
<img src="images/i_346.jpg" width="568" height="481" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"YOU!"</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing here? You have,
no doubt, been to the house? My God, if
you have been seen!"</p>

<p>"They may see me now, when they like&mdash;I
care not! The blow is struck."</p>

<p>"The blow&mdash;what do you mean? I don't
understand you&mdash;you terrify me. What
brings you here? You are not a bad-hearted
man, you do not seek anybody's life?"</p>

<p>"Don't I? What I want to do is to blow
up everybody here!&mdash;this kind of thing has
lasted too long. The reign of masters and
people of fortune is over!"</p>

<p>"Unhappy man, what are you saying?
Have you lost your senses?"</p>

<p>"What am I saying?&mdash;this! Look at that
house blazing with light, where they are
feasting&mdash;the house of our exploiter, isn't it&mdash;where
he is regaling his well-to-do friends?
Well, in ten minutes, they will all be blown
up."</p>

<p>"Blown up!&mdash;blown up!" repeated Marianne,
almost mad with terror.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is there I have just come from;
the dynamite is placed, the fuse lit; at
midnight&mdash;the explosion!"</p>

<p>Marianne comprehended. Out of herself,
she sprang upon Jacques Houdaille.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" she shrieked. "Wretch!&mdash;all
the children in the country are there&mdash;ours&mdash;yours&mdash;monster!"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;my children?" cried the man,
passing the back of his hand across his brow
and nearly sinking to the ground, but
instantly recovering himself and disappearing
into the darkness in the direction of the
house.</p>

<p>Marianne was already there. She sprang
across the threshold and, flinging the door
wide open, cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The house is mined! Save yourselves!
Save yourselves, all of you!"</p>

<p>At any other time, those who heard her
might have thought her mad, and hesitated
before taking flight; but, in the threatening
circumstances of the hour, she had scarcely
opened her lips before her appearance had
told of danger.</p>

<p>The stronger carried out the weaker and
the youngest of the party, while their elders
threw open all the doors and drove the little
ones out before them. By good fortune, the
feast had been given on the ground floor, a
few steps only from the street. In a few
moments the house was emptied, the outer
gates passed.</p>

<p>The twelfth stroke of midnight was sounding
on the factory clock when a terrible explosion
was heard, and the house, full of
light and the odours of the entertainment so
rudely interrupted, was blown into the air
and fell in a heap of ruins.</p>

<p>There was a frightful panic and flight.
The street, but a few moments before so full
of cheerful sounds, became suddenly silent,
as if death had taken the place of life there.</p>

<p>At a short distance, one woman alone remained&mdash;a
woman with an infant in her arms
and three other children clinging to her skirt.</p>

<p>This woman, followed by her children,
advanced.</p>

<p>One gaslight only was burning in the
street, lighting the immense hecatomb and
casting its trembling rays upon the body of
a man.</p>

<p>She wished to reach this body, to see
whether she recognised it&mdash;praying to God
that it might be <i>him</i>, preferring rather to
know that he was dead than a living assassin.</p>

<p>A glance sufficed, and, hiding her face,
forcing back the tears that were swelling her
bosom to bursting, she drew her children to
her and fell upon her knees.</p>

<p>Through its windows the little workmen's
church of the quarter seemed to be on fire,
and the bells pealed out with their utmost
power of sound, calling the faithful to the
midnight service. But in the higher part of
the town the news of the explosion had
spread with immense rapidity, and presently
an ever-growing crowd gathered from all
points, manifesting terror and indignation.</p>

<p>The body of the man was examined and
identified.</p>

<p>"Jacques Houdaille, the Anarchist!" was
cried on all sides.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marianne, facing the exasperated
crowd and protecting her children
with her trembling hands; "the Anarchist&mdash;but
who did not hesitate to rush on to death
to save us, and accepted that fate as an
expiation."</p>

<h3>XXXII.&mdash;THE BARONESS BURDETT-COUTTS.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A name</span> that is a household
word; a personage that occupies
a position unique; one
who is deservedly respected
and honoured by all classes;
to whom individuals and bodies
of people have turned for sympathy and
help, and in whose hearts is built a monument
of gratitude, such as surely has seldom
been accorded to any human being&mdash;such
is the truly noble woman who has been for
upwards of half a century the pioneer of the
majority of benevolent movements and the
ready helper of the helpless.</p>

<p>Here is a long life of good deeds,
of which yet no record exists: nothing
beyond paragraphic accounts&mdash;which, spread
out over so great a lapse of time, are
lost to sight and memory. Interviews,
too, have never been granted; and when
I am told an exception is to be made
in my favour, I am not only sincerely
gratified, but am also impressed with the
magnitude of my task, and the honour
conferred upon me by being enabled to give
to the world some account of the life and
work of one of the most remarkable women
of the age.</p>

<p>Miss Burdett was the youngest daughter
of Sir Francis Burdett, Bart., one of the chief
political characters of the early part of the
century; who married one of the daughters
of Mr. Coutts, the banker, and of whom I
shall have more to say later on. On the
death of the banker's widow, who had, after
the death of Mr. Coutts, married the Duke
of St. Albans, the subject of this article found
the enormous fortune was bequeathed to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
She, at the age of twenty-three, was the head
of a banking-house second only to the Bank
of England, and veritably the richest woman
in the land.</p>

<p>What would she do with it?&mdash;was the question
that would occur to many, and all sorts
of surmises would be promulgated, and
various schemes of disbursement planned by
many well-intentioned, but too busy, people.
We may readily conjecture that, in many
hands, this vast wealth would have fulfilled
a very different mission; would have
contributed rather to the selfish pleasure of
its possessor than to the wants of the many.
As it is&mdash;but as you read you will gather
some idea, though necessarily a limited one,
of what <i>has</i> been done.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>HOLLY LODGE.</p>

<p><i>From a Water-Colour Drawing by Warne Browne.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>To look back upon the life of the Baroness
is an historical education. One recalls the
good and the great with whom she has been
associated, reads the history of the labouring
classes, watches the education of the young,
and reviews events which have stirred nations:
and in each and every case, where money
could help, the Baroness has led the way
with munificent benevolence, and what is
more, has brought the effect of her example,
and so used her enormous influence,
that others have thereby been induced
likewise to afford valuable assistance.</p>

<p>Every grade of life, from the man of culture,
high in his profession, to the mechanic
or even the "coster" of the streets, has
representatives who owe much to her practical
help; financial assistance for those who
needed it; with encouragement and kindly
patronage, combined with the opportunity
of meeting the first in the ranks of the
world's genius&mdash;to those who, standing alone,
would have been lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>Her doors have ever been open. Kings,
statesmen, churchmen, writers, artists, travellers,
and scholars&mdash;all have been proud to
call her friend; and to each and all has she
proved herself worthy of their confidence and
esteem.</p>

<p>My interview was accorded at Holly
Lodge, a charming retreat on the Northern
Heights of London, approached by a steep
hill, and standing back in its own grounds in
perfect seclusion.</p>

<p>We sat chatting together under the trees:
the "we" being the Baroness, Mr. Burdett-Coutts,
M.P., Colonel Saunderson, M.P., Mr.
Edmund Caldwell, artist, and myself. A very
pleasant spot it was; a natural group of
immense trees, under whose branches it was
possible to feel cool in almost tropical heat,
and to enjoy to the full comfortable basket
chairs, with bamboo tables, on which are
scattered flowers, fruit, and books. Particularly
kind had been my reception, and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
been at once struck with the charming grace
of manner and courtesy of the old school
evidenced by the Baroness. Tall, slender,
with a carriage that would credit a woman
of half her age, and a remarkable personality
that at once makes itself apparent, you have
before you one gifted with talents of no
mean order, with strong power of penetration,
and, above all, with a kindly and
generous nature, a sympathetic heart, and a
sincere Christian feeling that finds happiness
in the happiness of others.</p>

<p>Mr. Burdett-Coutts, a man of distinguished
appearance, pleasing manners, an active and
willing coadjutor in the charitable works of
his wife, an excellent speaker, an earnest
politician, and regular attendant at the
House&mdash;where he has piloted one or two
Bills successfully&mdash;a cultured, scholarly man,
the writer of more than one clever work, and
possessor of one of the finest studs&mdash;Brookfield&mdash;in
the country.</p>

<p>Everyone knows Colonel Saunderson by
reputation. He is often heard in the House,
where his keen wit and satire create the
strongest interest when he is about to speak,
and make him at the same time a veritable
"thorn in the flesh" to his opponents. Every
inch a soldier, and also the most entertaining
of hosts and desirable of guests, you can
fancy him leading his men into action with
flashing eye and stentorian tones, or keeping
the whole table alive with witty speech and
keen repartee.</p>

<p>Of Edmund Caldwell's work you will note
evidences in the illustrations of this article.
Perhaps you have seen some at the Academy,
where he has several times made notable
exhibits; chiefly of hounds, puppies, and
kittens. The one hung in 1887 will be,
perhaps, best remembered. "For the Safety
of the Public" is its title. It gained immense
popularity, and the etching by Hester still
commands a large sale. Mr. Caldwell&mdash;who
is spoken of in art circles as the coming
Landseer&mdash;is one of the most modest,
unassuming men I have ever met; yet if
once drawn into conversation, he speaks with
earnestness and ability.</p>

<p>So much for the personages with whom I
am conversing; now, as minor characters, I
dismiss them, and resume with the Baroness.</p>

<p>Holly Lodge has much the appearance of
a bungalow&mdash;it is quite small, surrounded by
a veranda, with its trellis-work covered with
hops, Virginia and other creepers; about
fifty-two acres of garden and park surround
it, so well wooded that, from the house, all
one gets of the exterior world is a glimpse of
a church spire. The place is old, and was
purchased by Mr. Coutts as a residence for
himself and second wife. Small as it is, it is
most extremely interesting, for it is full of
associations of the many friends of the
Baroness&mdash;of all sorts and conditions of
people, and from all parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Stepping over the threshold (where, by-the-bye,
I notice a horse-shoe nailed&mdash;a reminiscence
of Mrs. Coutts), you are at once in
a cool entrance-hall, hung with some rare old
prints and portraits, amongst them being the
Queen, the Prince Consort, and a print of
Sir Francis Burdett riding triumphantly on a
car of curious construction to the "Crown
and Anchor." Everybody knows&mdash;who knows
anything of political history at all&mdash;how
fiercely Sir Francis fought for the rights of the
people and the Reform Bill. Poor old gentleman!
His career was by no means smooth.
Do you remember how he was committed to
the Tower for breach of privilege? I thought
of it when I looked at this queer print, and
called to mind a room in the Stratton Street
residence of the Baroness, which was pointed
out to me as the one where the military had
broken in the windows in order to capture
him, he having barricaded his house. How,
when at last he surrendered, the Guards were
pelted with stones, the people shouting:
"Burdett for ever!"</p>

<p>A little farther on in the hall is Bassano's
"Spoiling the Egyptians"; then a print of a
vessel that made one of the first Arctic
voyages, the back of it being fitted with a
glass case containing small trophies given by
the commander to the Baroness; then I
note a picture denoting a reception of
Volunteers on the lawn of Holly Lodge more
than a quarter of a century ago. And here
I must remark on the great patriotism always
displayed by the Baroness. When the
Volunteer movement was quite in its infancy,
she was one of its most ardent supporters,
as indeed she ever has been of anything for
the benefit of a country she holds dear. Now
we pause before a print of Mr. Coutts, and I
listen to a funny story about him which I
must tell you.</p>

<p>It seems he was a very eccentric man, and,
despite his great wealth, was often very
shabbily dressed. Tall, of singularly refined
and stately bearing, he was one day walking
out in his favourite attitude&mdash;hands behind
his back. As he thus walked, he attracted
the attention of another gentleman, who was
also taking a constitutional; and who was
immediately moved with sympathy for the
evident poverty of the shabby-genteel indivi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>dual
in front of him. Being himself in fairly
affluent circumstances, he determined to
afford some slight relief to the decayed
gentleman who seemed to need it so much,
and who, doubtless, would not disclose his
position in order to obtain assistance.
Accordingly, he slipped quietly and quickly
up behind him, and putting a couple of
guineas into the outstretched hands, he as
suddenly withdrew; before the astonished
recipient was sufficiently aroused from his
reverie to remonstrate. You can well
imagine the surprise of the benevolent
old gentleman on the next evening, when,
on attending a select dinner-party given
in honour of Mr.
Coutts, the banker,
he recognised in
him the "decayed
gentleman" on
whom he had
bestowed his well-meant
charity the
day before!</p>

<p>Were I to particularize
the
reminiscences of
good and great
who are departed
that I saw at Holly
Lodge, it would be
an almost endless
task. In different
parts of the house
I came across memories
of Dickens,
Wellington, Garrick,
Gordon, and
many others. Wellington
was the
firmest of friends,
taking a fatherly interest in the career of the
young girl with her millions of money and her
large heart; Dickens and she together visited
some of the vilest dens of London, when
"slumming" was not fashionable, and even
philanthropists were not safe in venturing
over the border from West to crime-polluted
and poverty-stricken East. If
the inimitable writer had never opened
the eyes of the many wilful blind to behold
the sorrows and sufferings of their plague-stricken
fellow creatures, he would not have
been unrewarded, for he it was who interested
the one of all others who was both able and
willing to afford timely help, and to turn
sorrow into joy, darkness into light.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>HOLLY LODGE&mdash;UNDER THE TREES.</p>

<p><i>From a Water-Colour Drawing by Warne Browne.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Nova Scotia Gardens, a resort of murderers,
thieves, disreputable and abandoned, where
rubbish and refuse were shot in heaps, a place
which had long been a trap for fevers and
loathsome diseases: this was the spot
where Miss Coutts introduced wholesale and
sweeping reform. Struck with the horror
and misery, she bought it all up, pulled
down the wretched buildings, and put up
four blocks of model dwellings, each block
containing between forty and fifty tenements,
with every accommodation in the shape of
laundry, baths, etc., and the luxury of a
good library and reading-room. This, for a
people who had been surrounded by abominations
of every description, whose every
breath had sucked in foul stench, and whose
every footstep had been in slimy pools and
decaying matter shot from dust-carts. These
buildings, I may add, not only hold their own
with those of much later date, but are actually
in advance of some for such general requirements
as drainage, ventilation, and light.
Columbia Square it was named, and from
then till now it has continued to be a much-to-be-desired
place of habitation for the class
for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>Now, glance at "Brown's Lane," another
place brightened and blessed by the practical
benevolence of Miss Coutts. Go back between
thirty and forty years, to a time when
the community known as "Hand Weavers"
were almost starving in consequence of loss
of trade following on importation of foreign
silks; when, despite of an association which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
had been formed for the amelioration of
the sufferers, distress was so prevalent that
nothing short of a miracle could stem it. Then
Miss Coutts came forward and became the
mainstay and almost the entire support of the
association. Some of the people were sent out
of the country as emigrants, others were
given the means of starting in little businesses;
girls were suitably trained for
respectable situations, and work was found
for the women in a sort of sewing-room,
where, after 1.30 in the day, they could
earn from 8s. to 15s. per week, thus helping
very materially to keep things going. The
work consisted of shirt-making for the police
and soldiers, and one very good feature of
the plan was, that each woman as she came
in was given a good, hearty meal to commence
with. Some, who on account of their
families could not leave home, were allowed
to have their work out; thus large numbers
were benefited. It must also be added that
many had actually to be taught the proper
use of their needle, and I am very
much inclined to think that the
same training is just as necessary
now amongst our East-end factory
hands.</p>

<p>Nor did the work of this true
charity stop there: the people were
especially visited in their homes on
an organized plan, and help afforded
them on the report furnished by the
visitors. Such visitors, being clergymen
and qualified lay people, were
fully competent to judge of the cases
with which they came in contact.
Clothing, blankets, provisions, and
wine were freely distributed; half-day
jobs were given to unemployed
men, outfits were provided for boys
and girls starting for new situations,
and nothing that money or care
could do was left undone.</p>

<p>Then distress broke out amidst
the tanners, and again Miss Coutts
found a way of helping. In a
practical manner, she appointed a
trusty agent to attend the police-courts
of the distressed districts,
where applications for relief were
received. By this means funds for
present wants were disbursed, and
also the means of saving their homes
to them until better times.</p>

<p>Some of you may remember the
cholera epidemic in the East-end of
London in 1867. Then was Miss
Coutts again the active benefactor,
and her's was the hand that gave freely,
and her's the judicious relief that can
never be adequately known or appreciated.
Under the superintendence of a qualified
medical man, she employed eight trained
nurses, two sanitary inspectors, and, under
their orders, four men to distribute disinfectants.
Let me give you a summary of <i>one</i>
week's absolute <i>gifts</i> during the course of
this fearful disease: 1,850 tickets for
meat, value 1s., 250lb. of arrowroot, 500lb.
of rice, 50lb. each of sago and tapioca,
30lb. black currant jelly, 50 gallons of
port wine, 25 gallons of brandy, 20 gallons
of beef tea, 560 quarts of milk, 100 blankets,
400yds. of flannel, and 400 garments: all
this in addition to doctor, nurse, and money!</p>

<p>A Shoe Black Brigade, a Boys' Club, and
a Relief Committee for discriminate charity
may be briefly referred to, as well as the more
recent Flower Girls' Brigade; the members
of the latter being not only helped and
befriended in their present occupation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
also taught the duties of domestic service,
or initiated into the art of artificial flower
making in the factory specially opened for
them. It is satisfactory to hear that this
one society has put upwards of 800 girls into
a more desirable way of earning their own
living.</p>

<p><i>From a Water-Colour Drawing by Warne Browne.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The portrait of Charles Dickens gave rise
to these reminders of work accomplished in
this direction; and now I take up another,
that of an aged coloured man, who, the
Baroness tells me, was the first convert of
one of the Colonial churches, in which she
has ever been much interested. She does
not, however, tell me what I subsequently
learn of these churches, for she is not given
to talking of her good deeds.</p>

<p>Now, what are the facts? Briefly these: In
her warm admiration of our own Church, and
her anxiety for its extension, she actually
founded the Bishoprics of Adelaide, British
Columbia, and Cape Town. I will give you
the cost of one; you will then see somewhat
of the magnitude of this branch of her benevolence.
For the endowment of the church,
&pound;25,000; for the bishopric, &pound;15,000; and
for the partial cost for clergy, &pound;10,000.</p>

<p>So much for the Church in foreign lands.
Now glance at what has been done for the
Church at home. Here we find that almost
the first use Miss Coutts made of her wealth
was to distribute it largely in assisting to
build churches in London and elsewhere.</p>

<p>At Carlisle she erected a handsome edifice,
seating about 700 people, to accommodate a
congregation formerly worshipping in a
disused warehouse; and at Westminster the
Church of St. Stephen's, with all its adjuncts
of schools and institute, was put up entirely
at her own cost, and stands as a lasting
monument, not only of her generosity, but
also of her practical forethought for all the
needs of the congregation, young and old.
It was in the year 1847 when the buildings
were commenced, the consecration taking
place in 1850. The actual cost was close
upon &pound;100,000. From then till now, the
Baroness has entirely supplied the working
expenses, no small item when one considers
the manifold
branches emanating
from this
centre of active
Christianity. No
wants are overlooked:
from the
tiniest toddler in
the infant class to
the grey-haired
worshipper at the
beautiful services,
some organization
embraces their
needs. Clubs,
guilds, classes,
friendly societies,
district visiting,
etc., are all in
active operation,
and, in addition,
a self-help club,
which deserves
more than passing
mention. Established
at a comparatively recent date on cooperative
principles, it can now show a working
capital of upwards of &pound;2,000. Of the success
of the schools I can give you no adequate idea,
for facts and figures fail to convey a thorough
grasp of the real benefit conferred upon,
literally, thousands of a rising generation.
When I tell you that upwards of fifteen
thousand boys and girls have in these schools
been properly trained for their future position
in the world, I tell you but little.</p>

<p>It was not only with these schools, however,
that Miss Coutts spent both time and
money: Stepney, Highgate, and many outlying
places have to thank her for substantial
aid in this direction. And what one must
admire is the very clear perception of all requirements,
as well as the prompt manner of
carrying out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Townshend Schools, at Westminster,
I must give you some slight particulars. The
schools were, in the first place, the outcome
of a fund of which Miss Coutts was left a
trustee, and which was also immediately
under her superintendence. They were
literally crowded with the children of people
residing in various districts of that part of
London, who, unable to pay the requisite
School Board fees, yet compelled to educate
their children, were thankful to avail themselves
of either the free admission or the
nominal charge of one penny, where it could
be afforded.</p>

<p>The Free Education Bill becoming law in
1890, made a re-organization of these schools
requisite, it being no longer necessary to do
what any School Board is compelled to do
by the Act. So now the whole of the
schools, St. Stephen's and Townshend, run
side by side, stepping-stones from each other.
Thus, the Townshend are now the "St.
Stephen's Elementary"&mdash;and entirely free;
while the "St. Stephen's Higher Grade," for
a charge of from twopence to sixpence per
week, are imparting sciences and 'ologies,
languages, and many other useful acquirements
to the deserving and persevering from
the "Elementary Schools"; the transition
being made the more easy by a large number of
scholarships open to students in the last-named.</p>

<p>The next step is to the "Technical
Institute," at which place scholars attending
the "Higher Grade" are received for evening
study, as are those who have formerly
attended them. The Institute is also open
to others who may
be disposed to
join, with this proviso&mdash;that
every student must be
either actually
earning his or her
living, or purposing
to do so, by
the arts and crafts
here taught.</p>

<p>At the Westminster
Institute
some hundreds of
students are receiving
instruction
likely to benefit
their entire future.
That they are
deriving immense
profit to themselves
was strongly
evidenced at the last annual meeting, which
meeting I had the pleasure of attending.
Here were youths and adults, many of
them with horny hands of toil, coming
forward to receive well-earned prizes and
certificates as a result of technical work
of no mean order; the Baroness herself
bestowing them with kind, encouraging words,
and in addition made a capital speech.
And, by the way, I thought we never <i>should</i>
get that speech, for when her ladyship stood
up to commence, the ovation was simply
tremendous; cheer upon cheer broke forth
again and again. When at length it did
subside, the immense audience (and hundreds
had been turned away), although the hour
was late, sat and stood in perfect silence,
eager to catch every word that fell from
her lips. The entire affair, in fact, had
resolved itself into an unmistakable tribute
of affectionate regard; for when the Baroness
had entered the hall at the commencement
of the evening, everyone present had sprung
to his feet and continued standing until
she herself was seated. No greater respect
could have been paid to Majesty itself; and
who better deserves it than one who has
made herself acquainted with the wants and
sorrows of her poorer brethren?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 584px;">

<div class="caption"><p>HOLLY LODGE&mdash;THE GARDEN.</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Sir Edmund Henderson.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>A new building for the students has just
been erected by the Baroness, as complete
in every way as skill and money can make
it: a series of workshops containing all
requisite tools, a first-rate library of technical
works, and everything one can think of.
Here boys and youths can become masters
of carpentry and joinery, bricklayers' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
plumbers' work, building construction and
builders' quantities, metal plate work, technical
and mechanical drawing, and applied art.
Girls can become practical cooks and dressmakers;
while either sex can go into the
Civil Service classes, and acquire book-keeping,
shorthand, languages, algebra, mathematics,
and a variety of the like useful
subjects. I may just add that more than
the usual percentage of medals and certificates
offered by the City and Guilds of
London, the Society of Arts, and the Science
and Art and Educational Department were this
last year carried off by these students. <i>Free
admission</i> is given to fifty scholars from the
lower school, by means of that number of
scholarships founded by the Baroness, other
scholarships being awarded annually to
deserving children of poor parents.</p>

<p>I may not linger on these educational
details, but will just mention the Whitelands
Training College and an Art Students' Home,
both of them owing their origin to the
Baroness, though the latter has since become
self-supporting. Then it must also be
remembered that some of the really useful
things now taught in our schools were
first taught there, owing to her persistent
efforts; as must also the fact that before
education was compulsory, she was a persistent
advocate for evening schools, herself
entirely supporting a large one in the East of
London.</p>

<p>For children the Baroness has always had
a large corner in her heart, likewise a large
corner in her pocket, for no effort has been
too great, if such effort could help the little
ones. Cruelty to children to her is one of
the greatest of iniquities, and it is mainly
due to her unceasing devotion that the Bill
of 1889&mdash;which has so materially improved
the condition of these poor little ones&mdash;passed
into law. That Bill made it lawful
to remove them from the custody of cruel
parents, and also to make such parents
contribute towards their support. Many of
you may not know that the formation
of the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children was chiefly due to her
ladyship, the first committee meeting taking
place in her own drawing-room. Great things
have sprung from it: for now there is an
average of ten thousand cases to deal with
annually.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE BOUDOIR.</p>

<p><i>From a Water-Colour Drawing by Warne Browne.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The "Destitute Children's Dinner Society"
is also dear to her heart; she has, in fact,
been its hard-working president since the
death of the good Earl of Shaftesbury. This
Society gives each season about three hundred
thousand substantial dinners, at a charge
of one penny or one halfpenny each.</p>

<p>After the children and the poor may be
mentioned the love of animals, ever shown
by Lady Coutts; she is, indeed, well known
everywhere for her good work in connection
with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, often attending meetings in its furtherance,
and identifying herself with the
annual cart-horse parades at London, Newcastle,
etc.; and what a number of animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
of all sorts and sizes, one sees at Holly
Lodge! Here is a white donkey, the gift
of a number of costermongers; and this
reminds me that the Baroness has been in
the habit of giving prizes to those men who
at the periodical shows could produce animals
well fed and well kept. And one of her
cherished possessions is a silver model of a
donkey presented to her by a costermongers'
club. These clubs, I may tell you, she has
promoted, with the object of assisting street
vendors to purchase their own barrows. The
requisite amount was advanced to the men,
which was repaid by a small weekly instalment.
There is no need to recall her
valuable help to the costers in the somewhat
recent crisis in their trade. Many of you
watched the struggle from one court to
another; but the donkey and barrow came
off triumphant,
and the men still
ply their calling
in our poorer
neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>At one time
the Baroness
kept llamas, but
found the climate
hardly suitable
for such
delicate animals,
so gave it up.
Two of the pretty
creatures are now
stuffed, and kept
indoors in a
handsome glass
home of their
own. She has also
some very fine
goats, to which special attention is paid. She
calls them the "poor man's cow," and believes
they might be made highly productive. I
go through the goat stables, first looking at
the champion, "Sir Garnet," the finest I
have ever seen; in fact, his keeper tells
me "he has never been beat"; then on
to see some "Nubians"&mdash;pretty, timid
creatures&mdash;from a few weeks old upwards.
Then I inspect some fine cows, beautiful
horses, pigs, fowls, and creatures of all sorts.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"SIR GARNET."</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Edmond Caldwell.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>We did no stereotyped inspection, but
just wandered here and there before and
after luncheon, chatting pleasantly, and stopping
now and again for anything with which
the Baroness was specially interested, or anything
that struck me in particular. Ever and
anon we sat and rested under the trees,
enjoying the welcome shade (for this was in
the hot days of last summer), and here we
had afternoon tea, surrounded by the sweet
smelling flowers, the singing of the birds, and
the hum of the bees: for the Baroness is an
enthusiastic bee-keeper, and is, indeed, the
president of the Bee Society. Privately, I
begin to wonder what society she is <i>not</i> connected
with.</p>

<p>In one of our wanderings we find ourselves
on a site known as "Traitors' Hill," actually
in the grounds, though right on the other
side. This was the spot where the conspirators
stood to watch what never came off&mdash;the
blowing up of the Houses of Parliament. A
clear view right over London, as it lays like a
huge panoramic picture that has paused for
the explanatory guide. Then we return <i>vi&acirc;</i>
long archways of flowers, gaily arranged
beds, and acres of kitchen garden. I notice
that the men employed
in the
grounds are by
no means young,
and am told that
unless they have
been there quite
a number of
years the others
look upon them
altogether as interlopers.
Many
are really past
actual work, but
there they stay
until such time as
the Baroness pensions
them off.</p>

<p>I have told you
Mr. Burdett-Coutts
has a fine
stud near: near enough, in fact, to send to
for some of the horses. I have no time to
visit the place, and when I hear a clattering
and whinnying, and find myself confronted
with a splendidly-matched pair called "The
Ladies," I am glad to have seen some specimens
of the fine English breed for which
their master has made himself famous. This
is indeed a pretty pair; full of fire, yet easily
controlled into the most gentle action.
They put me in mind of twin sisters, for
I have to walk round them two or three
times in my endeavours to tell "t'other from
which." This is the pair with which Mr.
Coutts is wont to drive the Baroness round
the park; generally accompanied by one
or two pet dogs. The dogs, they are of
great importance at Holly Lodge: "Peter"
and "Prince" being the favourites, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
former generally accompanying his mistress
wherever she goes; he has a decided taste for
geological survey; and indoors there is quite
a collection made by him, borrowed from all
parts, the Continent and at home. Another
valuable canine had for its father a favourite
of the Emperor Charles Frederick; and still
others possess histories of their own, for
which I have not space. One thing I <i>can</i>
give, though, and that is a good photographic
reproduction of a group, specially taken for
this Magazine, and given at the head of
this article; there you will observe the
Baroness, Mr. Burdett-Coutts, and the dogs,
grouped on the summit of the "Lodge"
steps. Also, you have a portrait of "Cocky,"
a self-asserting cockatoo, one of a tribe of
feathered creatures, happy and well fed, who
live in and around the house. At one time,
the Baroness tells me, she made efforts
to induce nightingales to build in the
surrounding trees, but ultimately had to give
it up, as they were just a prize for the bird-fanciers.</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Edmond Caldwell.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>At Haydn Hall, a former residence, large
numbers of robins were daily fed, and it was
quite a usual thing on a winter's morning to
hear their little beaks tapping the windows of
the sleeping
apartments of the
Baroness, as a
reminder that
they were ready
for their breakfast.
She is a
firm friend of the
sweet singing
bird, and whether
it has been in
indefatigably promoting
an Act for
their protection
during the breeding
season, or
whether it has
consisted in
earnest remonstrances
against
the reprehensible
practice, followed
by so many ladies,
of wearing wings
and even small
birds, they have
found in her a
zealous and
powerful advocate.</p>

<p>We are strolling
across the lawn, and are suddenly confronted
with an Oriental structure in the grounds,
named "Candilia," erected in memory of the
Turkish Compassionate Fund. Do you
remember the horrors which thrilled all
Europe when recounted? Filled with sorrowing
pity for the sufferings of the thirty thousand
families&mdash;passive victims&mdash;who had fled
for refuge to the villages of the Danube, the
Baroness took the matter up warmly, and
wrote a letter to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which
quickly found sympathetic response throughout
the country. I cannot do better than
give you an extract from this letter:</p>

<p>"I would pray one and all to bear in mind
the unhappy sufferers in a far-away country,
of another creed, whose lives are ebbing fast
away, uncheered, desolate, and abandoned.
We cannot, perhaps, stanch their lifeblood;
we can wash our hands, though, free
of its stain, by binding up their wounds, if
not by our money, by our sympathy. If
silver and gold there is none, we have prayers
still; and He to whom all flesh comes, hears
the cry of the poor for His creatures suffering
from the sword, as He also accepts the
gifts of the rich.... When your vast
public reads these few lines, I trust much
bodily or mental
anguish will begin
to be soothed,
through that real
Christianity
which is still, in
God's providence,
the appointed
means
by which hunger
and thirst are
assuaged, sickness
alleviated,
and consolation
given."</p>

<p>This letter was
eminently characteristic
of her
whole manner
and conversation:
kindly, gentle,
mindful of
her "duty to her
neighbour," and
anxious to do
that duty. How
much better and
happier the world
would be for
more of such!</p>

<p>Well, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
"Compassionate Fund" was at once
formed, the Baroness starting it with a
subscription of &pound;1,000&mdash;which sum she
afterwards doubled. Collections were made
in all parts, and in a few days &pound;30,000 and
a prodigious amount of clothing and food
were ready for dispatch. Mr. Burdett-Coutts
went out as "Special Commissioner," Sir
Francis de Winton and other officers affording
valuable assistance. What they had to
contend with was simply appalling: famine,
pestilence, bitter weather, roads crowded with
destitute masses of people&mdash;many being literally
frozen to death; women actually throwing
their children into the rivers to save them
further sufferings. Driven from place to
place, they at length reached Constantinople,
where some found refuge in mosques, some
in the houses of the rich, and a large number
in the Royal Palace itself, which the Sultan
at once threw open for them.</p>

<p>Nearer the house the Baroness shows me
the tent dressing-rooms for gentlemen visitors,
which she has had put up on account of the
extreme smallness of the house, rendering
further accommodation necessary when guests
are invited to dinner. From there we go to
view the kitchens&mdash;models of neatness, and
bright with tiled walls and polished steel.</p>

<p>Then up into the house again, through a
long, roomy apartment, that seems wholly
intended for a conservatory, and, indeed, communicates
with it actually: an apartment
that contains all sorts of curios and precious
things; that is cool, comfortable, and home-like,
and has, moreover, a beautiful view of
the grounds. Here we stop to inspect what
is the finest&mdash;because most perfect&mdash;collection
of minerals extant. This mineral
museum was formerly the property of Professor
Tennant: it is a study in itself. Then
there is quite a collection of china, all
fashioned in imitation of vegetables, a
Chinese dragon, a clock tower carved by
Russian prisoners, and many other objects of
interest.</p>

<p>In the other rooms I note some fine
paintings by Wilkie, Brenghel, Harrison
Weir, Frith, Teniers, and Hogarth; in
addition to several by the before-mentioned
Edmund Caldwell. One of his, a comic
Christmas card, is here reproduced; it shows
the pets of the Baroness. The Baroness is
essentially English in her tastes; and at her
residence shows her preference for English
workmanship&mdash;even the piano in her boudoir
is from the old English firm of Broadwood
and Son; and other articles in unison.</p>

</div>

<p>I am not done with portraits yet: here is
one of Sir James Brook, an old friend of the
Baroness, and another living instance of one
who has been materially assisted by her. An
ordinary English gentleman in the first place,
he became King of Borneo, and founded a
sovereignty! Then there is Dr. Moffat, Dr.
Livingstone, and other illustrious men; and
last, but not least, the brave Christian
General and martyr, Gordon. In quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
tones and with saddened mien, the Baroness
tells me how much she valued his friendship,
and how he often came to see her; how his
almost, if not quite, last visit was paid to
her; and how, during that visit, he took up
a small letter-case lying handy, asking,
"Might he have it for a keepsake?" and how
she had since had proof of this keepsake
being carried with him in his breast-pocket
until his death.</p>

</div>

<p>How much his captivity must have grieved
his friend can only be faintly surmised by
her scheme, in conjunction with a few friends,
for opening up communication with Khartoum
by means of a Morocco merchant, who, disguising
himself, managed to convey to poor
Gordon the last letters and papers he ever
received from England.</p>

<p>No efforts were made by us to rescue
him; and well and nobly did the Baroness
publicly plead on behalf of her friend. The
shame and the disgrace made men and
women blush for their country; and when
Lady Coutts's letter found its way
into the <i>Times</i>, it awoke a universal
thrill from all classes. We mourn
still the loss of his noble life; and
some of us wonder at the necessity
of the public appeal for funds by the
late Lord Tennyson in order that
the Boys' Home, a work dear to the
brave General, could be carried on.
Is it that we forget?</p>

<p>I might keep on indefinitely telling
you of the different things taken
up by the Baroness, for everywhere I
turn I have something to remind
me of such. Now it is the portrait
of a most handsome bouquet which
had been presented to her by a
deputation of Irish women. Everybody
knows how again and again
the Baroness has spent immense
sums in relieving this unfortunate
people: in famine and sickness she
has come forward for years past and
tendered timely help, always seeking,
as she herself said, "to improve their
moral as well as their material condition."
Of the amount of money,
food, fuel, clothing, etc., disbursed I
cannot give you any correct total,
spreading as the work has over so
long a period; but I <i>can</i> tell you
how, thirteen years ago, she offered
the munificent sum of &pound;250,000
to the Government for them to
use beneficially in aid of the Irish
destitute.</p>

<p>Some of this great work was carried on in
the fishing villages, where dire famine had made
such havoc, that craft had either gone or was
in such a battered condition for want of
repair that fishing was practically impossible.
Scots were actually fishing in the
Irish waters, and selling the same fish
to those of the Irish who had money to
buy with. Then the Baroness made
loans to the deserving men of sums of
&pound;300, in order that they might purchase
new boats, the loans to be repaid by small
yearly instalments. Later on, her ladyship
established a Fishing School, in which four
hundred boys from all parts of Ireland could
be thoroughly initiated into boat-building,
net-making and mending, etc., carpentering,
coopering, and fish-curing. This school the
Baroness opened herself in the year 1887,
and can it be wondered at that when their
well-tried friend came among them, arriving
at night by yacht, flags, table-cloths, and
pocket-handkerchiefs bedecked the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
the people came together in huge crowds,
and large bonfires gave ruddy lights on all
the surrounding hills? When the actual
opening took place on the next day, the
scene of enthusiasm was almost unexampled&mdash;not
in any degree lessened by the presence
of a large number of deputations to present
addresses.</p>

<p>When I come to the question of her private
and individual charities, I must honestly
confess that this is a subject upon which I
can give you no information. As you may
imagine, begging letters arrive in batches,
and few that are really deserving apply
altogether in vain. Of this the public learns
nothing, neither did I, beyond the actual fact
above stated.</p>

<p>Everyone was glad when the honour of a
peerage was conferred upon Miss Coutts in
1871. This is an instance unique when
connected with a woman for her own worthy
deeds. The bestowal, to my mind, conferred
as much honour upon the Queen who gave
it as upon the subject who received it. The
Baroness also wears the Orders of the
Medjidieh and the Shafakat, given by the
Sultan in token of his gratitude for her services
to the unfortunate refugees. In addition to
this she has had the freedom of several cities
conferred upon her.</p>

<p>The last undertaking I shall mention is a
literary one; this, by the way, not the first.
The Chicago Exhibition is now a thing of
the past; but Lady Coutts has given us a
work in connection with it that deserves
a place on the shelves of every library in
the land. I refer to the book, "Woman's
Mission," undertaken by the Baroness at
the express wish of H.R.H. the Princess
Christian. Certainly the Princess could not
have placed the commission in more able
hands; and the
result confirms
her judgment.
The Baroness set
about it in the
very best possible
manner, and instead
of collecting
reports,
statistics, etc.,
which would only
have proved dull
and uninteresting,
she put herself
in communication
with a large number of such well-known
ladies as Florence Nightingale, Miss Agnes
Weston, etc., and from them obtained accounts
of the different works in which they
were engaged as women <i>for</i> women&mdash;each
and every paper being stamped with an individual
personality which gives life and interest
as well as facts and truisms. No fewer than
thirty-five of such papers are here presented
to the readers of the book, two of them
written by the Baroness herself, who has, in
addition, also written a lengthy appendix
touching upon each; and a preface of remarkable
power and earnestness, treating, as
it does, of the progressive education of women
during the last sixty years.</p>

</div>

<p>This, to even a casual observer, is a marvellous
production for anyone who has spent
the best years of so long a life; and was, as
the Baroness herself told me, only undertaken
at earnest solicitation, and with the
hope that good might be done by its publication,
not only by bringing our American
sisters more closely in touch with us, but
also as a useful review of work accomplished
by the women of our country, from the richest
to the poorest.</p>

<p>I feel I have far exceeded the limits of a
magazine article, but could have continued
interminably, so vast has been the goodness
and the magnitude of true charity and loving
sympathy of the subject of this interview.
Not only England, but the world has been
better for such a life in our midst: and from
many a thousand homes scattered in every
part of the globe the name of the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts is blessed and honoured.</p>

<p>As I drive to the station in her comfortable
carriage, laden with some of her fairest
flowers, I feel that this day's interview will be
memorable to me for all time to come.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE LOSS OF SAMMY CROCKETT.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_361.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was, of course, always a part
of Martin Hewitt's business to
be thoroughly at home among
any and every class of people,
and to be able to interest himself
intelligently, or to appear
to do so, in their various pursuits. In one
of the most important cases ever placed in
his hands, he could have gone but a short
way toward success had he not displayed
some knowledge of the more sordid aspects
of professional sport, and a great interest in
the undertakings of a certain dealer therein.
The great case itself had nothing to do with
sport, and, indeed, from a narrative point of
view, was somewhat uninteresting, but the
man who alone held the one piece of information
wanted was a keeper, backer, or
"gaffer" of professional pedestrians, and it
was through the medium of his pecuniary
interest in such matters that Hewitt was
enabled to strike a bargain with him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 614px;">
<img src="images/i_361b.jpg" width="614" height="465" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I'VE GOT THE WINNER IN THIS HOUSE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The man was a publican on the outskirts
of Padfield, a northern town pretty famous for
its sporting tastes, and to Padfield, therefore,
Hewitt betook himself, and, arrayed in a
way to indicate some inclination
of his own toward sport, he began
to frequent the bar of the "Hare
and Hounds." Kentish, the
landlord, was a stout, bull-necked
man,
of no great
communicativeness at
first: but after
a little acquaintance he
opened out
wonderfully,
became quite
a jolly (and
rather intelligent)
companion,
and
came out with
innumerable
anecdotes of
his sporting
adventures.
He could put a very decent dinner on the
table, too, at the "Hare and Hounds," and
Hewitt's frequent invitation to him to join
therein and divide a bottle of the best in the
cellar soon put the two on the very best
of terms. Good terms with Mr. Kentish was
Hewitt's great desire, for the information he
wanted was of a sort that could never be
extracted by casual questioning, but must be
a matter of open communication by the
publican, extracted in what way it might be.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Kentish one day, "I'll
put you on to a good thing, my boy&mdash;a real
good thing. Of course, you know all about
the Padfield 135 Yards Handicap being run
off now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't looked into it much,"
Hewitt replied. "Ran the first round of heats
last Saturday and Monday, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"They did. Well"&mdash;Kentish spoke in a
stage whisper as he leaned over and rapped the
table&mdash;"I've got the final winner in this
house." He nodded his head, took a puff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
at his cigar, and added, in his ordinary voice,
"Don't say nothing."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Got something on,
of course?"</p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think? Got any
price I liked. Been saving him up for this.
Why, he's got twenty-one yards, and he can
do even time all the way! Fact! Why, he
could win runnin' back'ards. He won his
heat on Monday like&mdash;like&mdash;like that!" The
gaffer snapped his fingers, in default of a
better illustration, and went on. "He
might ha' took it a little easier, <i>I</i> think&mdash;it's
shortened his price, of course, him jumpin'
in by two yards. But you can get decent
odds now, if you go about it right. You take
my tip&mdash;back him
for his heat next
Saturday, in the
second round, and
for the final. You'll
get a good price
for the final, if you
pop it down at
once. But don't
go makin' a song
of it, will you, now?
I'm givin' you a tip
I wouldn't give
anybody else."</p>

<p>"Thanks very
much&mdash;it's awfully
good of you. I'll
do what you
advise. But isn't there
a dark horse anywhere
else?"</p>

<p>"Not dark to
me, my boy, not
dark to me. I
know every man
runnin' like a book.
Old Taylor&mdash;him
over at the Cop&mdash;he's got a very good
lad&mdash;eighteen yards, and a very good lad indeed;
and he's a tryer this time, I know. But,
bless you, my lad could give him ten, instead
o' taking three, and beat him then! When
I'm runnin' a real tryer, I'm generally runnin'
something very near a winner, you bet; and
this time, mind, <i>this</i> time, I'm runnin' the
certainest winner I <i>ever</i> run&mdash;and I don't
often make a mistake. You back him."</p>

<p>"I shall, if you're as sure as that. But
who is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Crockett's his name&mdash;Sammy Crockett.
He's quite a new lad. I've got young
Steggles looking after him&mdash;sticks to him like
wax. Takes his little breathers in my bit
o' ground at the back here. I've got a cinder
sprint path there, over behind the trees. I don't
let him out o' sight much, I can tell you.
He's a straight lad, and he knows it'll be
worth his while to stick to me: but there's
some 'ud poison him, if they thought he'd
spoil their books."</p>

<p>Soon afterward the two strolled toward
the tap-room. "I expect Sammy'll be
there," the landlord said, "with Steggles. I
don't hide him too much&mdash;they'd think I'd
got something extra on, if I did."</p>

<p>In the tap-room sat a lean, wire-drawn-looking
youth, with sloping shoulders and a
thin face, and by his side was a rather short,
thick-set man, who had an odd air, no matter
what he did, of proprietorship and surveillance
of the lean youth. Several other men sat
about, and there was loud laughter, under
which the lean youth looked sheepishly
angry.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 602px;">
<img src="images/i_362.jpg" width="602" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IN THE TAP-ROOM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Tarn't no good, Sammy lad," someone
was saying. "You a makin' after Nancy
Webb&mdash;she'll ha' nowt to do with 'ee."</p>

<p>"Don' like 'em so thread-papery," added
another. "No, Sammy, you aren't the lad
for she. I see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about Nancy Webb?" asked
Kentish, pushing open the door. "Sammy's
all right, anyway. You keep fit, my lad, an'
go on improving, and some day you'll have
as good a house as me. Never mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
lasses. Had his glass o' beer, has he?"
This to Raggy Steggles, who, answering in
the affirmative, viewed his charge as though
he were a post, and the beer a recent coat of
paint.</p>

<p>"Has two glasses of mild a-day," the
landlord said to Hewitt. "Never puts on
flesh, so he can stand it. Come out now."
He nodded to Steggles, who rose, and
marched Sammy Crockett away for exercise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following afternoon (it was Thursday),
as Hewitt and Kentish chatted in the
landlord's own snuggery, Steggles burst into
the room in a great state of agitation and
spluttered out: "He&mdash;he's bolted; gone
away!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Sammy&mdash;gone. Hooked it. <i>I</i> can't find
him."</p>

<p>The landlord stared blankly at the trainer,
who stood with a sweater dangling from his
hand, and stared blankly back. "What
d'ye mean?" Kentish said, at last. "Don't
be a fool. He's in the place somewhere;
find him."</p>

<p>But this Steggles defied anybody to
do. He had looked already. He had left
Crockett at the cinder-path behind the trees,
in his running-gear, with the addition of the
long overcoat and cap he used in going
between the path and the house, to guard
against chill. "I was goin' to give him a
bust or two with the pistol," the trainer explained,
"but when we got over t'other side,
'Raggy,' ses he, 'it's blawin' a bit chilly. I
think I'll ha' a sweater&mdash;there's one on my
box, ain't there?' So in I coomes for the
sweater, and it weren't on his box, and when
I found it and got back&mdash;he weren't there.
They'd seen nowt o' him in t' house, and he
weren't nowhere."</p>

<p>Hewitt and the landlord, now thoroughly
startled, searched everywhere, but to no
purpose. "What should he go off the place
for?" asked Kentish, in a sweat of apprehension.
"'Tain't chilly a bit&mdash;it's warm&mdash;he
didn't want no sweater; never wore one
before. It was a piece of kid to be able to
clear out. Nice thing, this is. I stand to win
two years' takings over him. Here&mdash;you'll
have to find him."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but how?" exclaimed the disconcerted
trainer, dancing about distractedly.
"I've got all I could scrape on him myself;
where can I look?"</p>

<p>Here was Hewitt's opportunity. He took
Kentish aside and whispered. What he said
startled the landlord considerably. "Yes,
I'll tell you all about that," he said, "if that's
all you want. It's no good or harm to me,
whether I tell or no. But can you find
him?"</p>

<p>"That I can't promise, of course. But
you know who I am now, and what I'm here
for. If you like to give me the information
I want, I'll go into the case for you, and, of
course, I sha'n't charge any fee. I may have
luck, you know, but I can't promise, of
course."</p>

<p>The landlord looked in Hewitt's face for a
moment. Then he said, "Done! It's a
deal."</p>

<p>"Very good," Hewitt replied; "get together
the one or two papers you have, and
we'll go into my business in the evening.
As to Crockett, don't say a word to anybody.
I'm afraid it must get out, since they
all know about it in the house, but there's
no use in making any unnecessary noise.
Don't make hedging bets or do anything
that will attract notice. Now we'll go over
to the hack and look at this cinder-path of
yours."</p>

<p>Here Steggles, who was still standing
near, was struck with an idea. "How about
old Taylor, at the Cop, guv'nor, eh?" he said,
meaningly. "His lad's good enough to win,
with Sammy out, and Taylor is backing him
plenty. Think he knows anything o' this?"</p>

<p>"That's likely," Hewitt observed, before
Kentish could reply. "Yes. Look here&mdash;suppose
Steggles goes and keeps his eye on
the Cop for an hour or two, in case there's
anything to be heard of? Don't show yourself,
of course."</p>

<p>Kentish agreed, and the trainer went.
When Hewitt and Kentish arrived at the
path behind the trees, Hewitt at once began
examining the ground. One or two rather
large holes in the cinders were made, as the
publican explained, by Crockett, in practising
getting off his mark. Behind these were
several fresh tracks of spiked shoes. The
tracks led up to within a couple of yards of
the high fence bounding the ground, and
there stopped abruptly and entirely. In the
fence, a little to the right of where the tracks
stopped, there was a stout door. This
Hewitt tried, and found ajar.</p>

<p>"That's always kept bolted," Kentish
said; "he's gone out that way&mdash;he couldn't
have gone any other without comin' through
the house."</p>

<p>"But he isn't in the habit of making a
step three yards long, is he?" Hewitt asked,
pointing at the last footmark and then at the
door, which was quite that distance away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
from it. "Besides," he added, opening the
door, "there's no footprint here nor outside."</p>

<p>The door opened on a lane, with another
fence and a thick plantation of trees at the
other side. Kentish looked at the footmarks,
then at the door, then down the lane,
and finally back towards the house. "That's
a licker," he said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/i_364.jpg" width="442" height="571" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THAT'S A LICKER!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"This is a quiet sort of lane," was Hewitt's
next remark. "No houses in sight. Where
does it lead?"</p>

<p>"That way it goes to the Old Kilns&mdash;disused.
This way down to a turning off the
Padfield and Catton Road."</p>

<p>Hewitt returned to the cinder-path again,
and once more examined the footmarks. He
traced them back over the grass toward the
house. "Certainly," he said, "he hasn't gone
back to the house. Here is the double
line of tracks, side by side, from the house&mdash;Steggles's
ordinary boots with iron tips and
Crockett's running pumps&mdash;thus they came
out. Here is Steggles's track in the opposite
direction alone, made when he went back for
the sweater. Crockett remained&mdash;you see
various prints in those loose cinders at the
end of the path where he moved this way
and that, and then two or three paces
toward the fence&mdash;not directly toward the
door, you notice&mdash;and there they stop dead,
and there are no more, either back or
forward. Now, if he had wings, I should be
tempted to the opinion that he flew straight
away in the air from that
spot&mdash;unless the earth swallowed
him and closed again
without leaving a wrinkle on
its face."</p>

<p>Kentish stared gloomily at
the tracks, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"However," Hewitt resumed,
"I think I'll take a
little walk now, and think
over it. You go into the
house and show yourself at
the bar. If anybody wants
to know how Crockett is,
he's pretty well, thank you.
By-the-bye, can I get to the
Cop&mdash;this place of Taylor's&mdash;by
this back lane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, down to the end
leading to the Catton Road,
turn to the left, and then first
on the right. Anyone'll show
you the Cop," and Kentish
shut the door behind the
detective, who straightway
walked&mdash;toward the Old
Kilns.</p>

<p>In little more than an
hour he was back. It was
now becoming dusk, and the
landlord looked out papers
from a box near the side
window of his snuggery, for
the sake of the extra light.
"I've got these papers together
for you," he said, as Hewitt entered. "Any
news?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very great. Here's a bit of
handwriting I want you to recognise, if you
can. Get a light."</p>

<p>Kentish lit a lamp, and Hewitt laid
upon the table half-a-dozen small pieces
of torn paper, evidently fragments of a letter
which had been torn up, here reproduced in
facsimile.</p>

<p>The landlord turned the scraps over, regarding
them dubiously. "These aren't
much to recognise, anyhow. <i>I</i> don't know
the writing. Where did you find 'em?"</p>

<p>"They were lying in the lane at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
back, a little way down. Plainly they are
pieces of a note addressed to someone
called Sammy or something very like it.
See the first piece with its 'mmy'? That is
clearly from the beginning of the note, because
there is no line between it and the
smooth, straight edge of the paper above;
also, nothing follows on the same line. Someone
writes to Crockett&mdash;presuming it to be a
letter addressed to him, as I do for other
reasons&mdash;as Sammy. It is a pity that there
is no more of the letter to be found than
these pieces. I expect the person who tore
it up put the rest in his pocket and dropped
these by accident."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 633px;">
<img src="images/i_365.jpg" width="633" height="225" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Kentish, who had been picking up and
examining each piece in turn, now dolorously
broke out:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's plain he's sold us&mdash;bolted and
done us; me as took him out o' the gutter,
too. Look here&mdash;'throw them over'; that's
plain enough&mdash;can't mean anything else.
Means throw <i>me</i> over, and my friends&mdash;me,
after what I've done for him. Then 'right
away'&mdash;go right away, I s'pose, as he has
done. Then," he was fiddling with the
scraps and finally fitted two together, "why,
look here, this one with 'lane' on it fits over
the one about throwing over, and it says
'poor f' where it's torn; that means 'poor
fool,' I s'pose&mdash;<i>me</i>, or 'fathead,' or something
like that. That's nice. Why, I'd twist his
neck if I could get hold of him; and I will!"</p>

<p>Hewitt smiled. "Perhaps it's not quite so
uncomplimentary after all," he said. "If you
can't recognise the writing, never mind. But
if he's gone away to sell you, it isn't much use
finding him, is it? He won't win if he
doesn't want to."</p>

<p>"Why, he wouldn't dare to rope under my
very eyes. I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well; perhaps we'll get him to run
after all, and as well as he can. One thing is
certain&mdash;he left this place of his own will.
Further, I think he is in Padfield now&mdash;he
went toward the town I believe. And I
don't think he means to sell you."</p>

<p>"Well, he shouldn't. I've made it worth
his while to stick to me. I've put a fifty on
for him out of my own pocket, and told him
so; and if he won, that would bring him a
lump more than he'd probably get by going
crooked, besides the prize money, and anything
I might give him over. But it seems
to me he's putting me in the cart altogether."</p>

<p>"That we shall see. Meantime, don't
mention anything I've told you to anyone&mdash;not
even to Steggles. He can't help us, and
he might blurt things out inadvertently.
Don't say anything about these pieces of
paper, which I shall keep myself. By-the-bye,
Steggles is indoors, isn't he? Very well,
keep him in. Don't let him be seen hunting
about this evening. I'll stay here to-night
and we'll proceed with Crockett's business in
the morning. And now we'll settle <i>my</i> business,
please."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the morning Hewitt took his breakfast
in the snuggery, carefully listening to any
conversation that might take place at the bar.
Soon after nine o'clock a fast dog-cart stopped
outside, and a red-faced, loud-voiced man
swaggered in, greeting Kentish with boisterous
cordiality. He had a drink with the landlord,
and said: "How's things? Fancy any
of 'em for the sprint handicap? Got a lad
o' your own in, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Kentish replied. "Crockett.
Only a young 'un&mdash;not got to his proper mark
yet, I reckon. I think old Taylor's got No. 1
this time."</p>

<p>"Capital lad," the other replied, with a
confidential nod. "Shouldn't wonder at all.
Want to do anything yourself over it?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't think so. I'm not on at
present. Might have a little flutter on the
grounds just for fun: nothing else."</p>

<p>There were a few more casual remarks, and
then the red-faced man drove away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 559px;">
<img src="images/i_366.jpg" width="559" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'CAPITAL LAD,' THE OTHER REPLIED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Hewitt, who had
watched the visitor through the snuggery
window.</p>

<p>"That's Danby&mdash;bookmaker. Cute chap;
he's been told Crockett's missing, I'll bet
anything, and come here to pump me. No
good though. As a matter of fact, I've
worked Sammy Crockett into his books for
about half I'm in for altogether&mdash;through
third parties, of course."</p>

<p>Hewitt reached for his hat. "I'm going
out for half an hour now," he said. "If
Steggles wants to go out before I come back,
don't let him. Let him go and smooth over
all those tracks on the cinder-path, very
carefully. And, by-the-bye, could you
manage to have your son about the place
to-day, in case I happen to want a little help
out of doors?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; I'll get him to stay in. But
what do you want the cinders smoothed for?"</p>

<p>Hewitt smiled and patted his host's
shoulder. "I'll explain all my little tricks
when the job's done," he said, and went out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the lane from Padfield to Sedby
village stood the "Plough" beerhouse,
wherein J. Webb was licensed to sell by
retail beer to be consumed on the premises
or off, as the thirsty list. Nancy Webb, with
a very fine colour, a very curly fringe, and a
wide-smiling mouth revealing
a fine set of teeth, came to
the bar at the summons of a
stoutish old gentleman with
spectacles, who walked with a
stick.</p>

<p>The stoutish old gentleman
had a glass of bitter beer and
then said, in the peculiarly
quiet voice of a very deaf
man: "Can you tell me, if
you please, the way into the
main Catton Road?"</p>

<p>"Down the lane, turn to
the right at the cross roads,
then first to the left."</p>

<p>The old gentleman waited
with his hand to his ear for
some few seconds after she
had finished speaking, and
then resumed, in his whispering
voice, "I'm afraid I'm
very deaf this morning." He
fumbled in his pocket and produced a
note-book and pencil. "May I trouble you to
write it down? I'm so very deaf at times,
that I&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>The girl wrote the direction, and the old
gentleman bade her good morning and left.
All down the lane he walked slowly with his
stick. At the cross roads he turned, put the
stick under his arm, thrust the spectacles
into his pocket, and strode away in the
ordinary guise of Martin Hewitt. He pulled
out his note-book, examined Miss Webb's
direction very carefully, and then went off
another way altogether, toward the "Hare
and Hounds."</p>

<p>Kentish lounged moodily in his bar.
"Well, my boy," said Hewitt, "has Steggles
wiped out the tracks?"</p>

<p>"Not yet&mdash;I haven't told him. But he's
somewhere about&mdash;I'll tell him now."</p>

<p>"No, don't. I don't think we'll have
that done, after all. I expect he'll want
to go out soon&mdash;at any rate, some time
during the day. Let him go whenever
he likes. I'll sit upstairs a bit in the club
room."</p>

<p>"Very well. But how do you know
Steggles will be going out?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's pretty restless after his lost
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, isn't he? I don't suppose he'll be
able to remain idle long."</p>

<p>"And about Crockett. Do you give him
up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Don't you be impatient. I
can't say I'm quite confident yet of laying
hold of him&mdash;the time is so short, you see&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>but
I think I shall at least have news for you
by the evening."</p>

<p>Hewitt sat in the club-room until the
afternoon, taking his lunch there. At length
he saw, through the front window, Raggy
Steggles walking down the road. In an
instant Hewitt was downstairs and at the
door. The road bent eighty yards away, and
as soon as Steggles passed the bend the
detective hurried after him.</p>

<p>All the way to Padfield town and more
than half through it Hewitt dogged the
trainer. In the end Steggles stopped at a
corner and gave a note to a small boy who
was playing near. The boy ran with the
note to a bright, well-kept house at the
opposite corner. Martin Hewitt was
interested to observe the legend "H. Danby,
Contractor," on a board over a gate in the
side wall of the garden behind this house.
In five minutes a door in the side gate
opened, and the head and shoulders of the
red-faced man emerged. Steggles immediately
hurried across and disappeared
through the gate.</p>

<p>This was both interesting and instructive.
Hewitt took up a position in the side street
and waited. In ten minutes the trainer
reappeared and hurried off the way he had
come, along the street Hewitt had
considerately left clear for him. Then Hewitt
strolled toward the smart house and took a
good look at it. At one corner of the small
piece of forecourt garden, near the railings,
a small, baize-covered, glass-fronted notice-board
stood on two posts. On its top edge
appeared the words "H. Danby. Houses
to be Sold or Let." But the only notice
pinned to the green baize within was an old
and dusty one, inviting tenants for three
shops, which were suitable for any business,
and which would be fitted to suit tenants.
Apply within.</p>

<p>Hewitt pushed open the front gate and
rang the door-bell. "There are some shops
to let, I see," he said, when a maid appeared.
"I should like to see them, if you will let
me have the key."</p>

<p>"Master's out, sir. You can't see the
shops till Monday."</p>

<p>"Dear me, that's unfortunate. I'm afraid
I can't wait till Monday. Didn't Mr. Danby
leave any instructions, in case anybody
should inquire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;as I've told you. He said
anybody who called about 'em must come
again on Monday."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then; I suppose I must try.
One of the shops is in High Street, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; they're all in the new part&mdash;Granville
Road."</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm afraid that will scarcely do. But
I'll see. Good day."</p>

<p>Martin Hewitt walked away a couple of
streets' lengths before he inquired the way to
Granville Road. When at last he found that
thoroughfare, in a new and muddy suburb,
crowded with brick-heaps and half-finished
streets, he took a slow walk along its entire
length. It was a melancholy example of
baffled enterprise. A row of a dozen or
more shops had been built before any
population had arrived to demand goods.
Would-be tradesmen had taken many of
these shops, and failure and disappointment
stared from the windows. Some were half
covered by shutters, because the scanty stock
scarce sufficed to fill the remaining half.
Others were shut almost altogether, the
inmates only keeping open the door for their
own convenience, and, perhaps, keeping
down a shutter for the sake of a little
light. Others again had not yet fallen
so low, but struggled bravely still to
maintain a show of business and prosperity,
with very little success. Opposite the
shops there still remained a dusty, ill-treated
hedge and a forlorn-looking field, which an
old board offered on building leases.
Altogether a most depressing spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>There was little difficulty in identifying the
three shops offered for letting by Mr. H.
Danby. They were all together near the
middle of the row, and were the only ones
that appeared not yet to have been occupied.
A dusty "To Let" bill hung in each window,
with written directions to inquire of Mr. H.
Danby or at No. 7. Now, No. 7 was a
melancholy baker's shop, with a stock of
three loaves and a plate of stale buns. The
disappointed baker assured Hewitt that he
usually kept the keys of the shops, but that
the landlord, Mr. Danby, had taken them
away the day before, to see how the ceilings
were standing, and had not returned them.
"But if you was thinking of taking a shop
here," the poor baker added, with some
hesitation, "I&mdash;I&mdash;if you'll excuse my advising
you&mdash;I shouldn't recommend it. I've
had a sickener of it myself."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/i_368.jpg" width="597" height="487" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I'VE HAD A SICKENER OF IT MYSELF."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hewitt thanked the baker for his advice,
wished him better luck in future, and left. To
the "Hare and Hounds" his pace was brisk.
"Come," he said, as he met Kentish's
inquiring glance, "this has been a very good
day, on the whole. I know where our man
is now, and I think we can get him, by a
little management."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, down in Padfield. As a matter of
fact, he's being kept there against his will, we
shall find. I see that your friend, Mr.
Danby, is a builder as well as a bookmaker."</p>

<p>"Not a regular builder. He speculates
in a street of new houses now and again,
that's all. But is he in it?"</p>

<p>"He's as deep in it as anybody, I think.
Now, don't fly into a passion. There are a
few others in it as well, but you'll do harm if
you don't keep quiet."</p>

<p>"But go and get the police&mdash;come and
fetch him, if you know where they're
keeping him; why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So we will, if we can't do it without
them. But it's quite possible we can, and
without all the disturbance and, perhaps,
delay that calling in the police would
involve. Consider, now, in reference to your
own arrangements. Wouldn't it pay you
better to get him back quietly, without a
soul knowing&mdash;perhaps not even Danby
knowing&mdash;till the heat is run to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it would, of course."</p>

<p>"Very good, then, so be it. Remember
what I have told you about
keeping your mouth shut&mdash;say
nothing to Steggles or
anybody. Is there a cab or
brougham your son and I
can have for the evening?"</p>

<p>"There's an old hiring
landau in the stables you
can shut up into a cab, if
that'll do."</p>

<p>"Excellent. We'll run
down to the town in it as
soon as it's ready. But,
first, a word about Crockett.
What sort of a lad is he?
Likely to give them trouble,
show fight, and make a
disturbance?"</p>

<p>"No, I should say not.
He's no plucked 'un,
certainly&mdash;all his manhood's in
his legs, I believe. You see,
he ain't a big sort o'
chap at best, and he'd be
pretty easy put upon&mdash;at least, I guess so."</p>

<p>"Very good, so much the better, for then
he won't have been damaged, and they will
probably only have one man to guard him.
Now the carriage, please."</p>

<p>Young Kentish was a six-foot sergeant of
Grenadiers, home on furlough, and luxuriating
in plain clothes. He and Hewitt walked a
little way towards the town, allowing the
landau to catch them up. They travelled in
it to within a hundred yards of the empty
shops and then alighted, bidding the driver
wait.</p>

<p>"I shall show you three empty shops,"
Hewitt said, as he and young Kentish walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
down Granville Road. "I am pretty sure
that Sammy Crockett is in one of them, and
I am pretty sure that that is the middle one.
Take a look as we go past."</p>

<p>When the shops had been slowly passed,
Hewitt resumed: "Now, did you see anything
about those shops that told a tale of any
sort?"</p>

<p>"No," Sergeant Kentish replied. "I can't
say I noticed anything beyond the fact that
they were empty&mdash;and likely to stay so, I
should think."</p>

<p>"We'll stroll back, and look in at the
windows, if nobody's watching us," Hewitt
said. "You see, it's reasonable to suppose
they've put him in the middle one, because
that would suit their purpose best. The
shops at each side of the three are occupied,
and if the prisoner struggled, or shouted, or
made an uproar, he might be heard if he
were in one of the shops next those inhabited.
So that the middle shop is the most likely.
Now, see there," he went on, as they stopped
before the window of the shop in question,
"over at the back there's a staircase not yet
partitioned off. It goes down below and up
above: on the stairs and on the floor near
them there are muddy footmarks. These
must have been made to-day, else they would
not be muddy, but dry and dusty, since there
hasn't been a shower for a week till to-day.
Move on again. Then you noticed that
there were no other such marks in the shop.
Consequently the man with the muddy feet
did not come in by the front door, but by
the back; otherwise he would have made a
trail from the door. So we will go round to
the back ourselves."</p>

<p>It was now growing dusk. The small
pieces of ground behind the shops were
bounded by a low fence, containing a door
for each house.</p>

<p>"This door is bolted inside, of course,"
Hewitt said, "but there is no difficulty in
climbing. I think we had better wait in the
garden till dark. In the meantime, the
gaoler, whoever he is, may come out;
in which case we shall pounce on him
as soon as he opens the door. You have
that few yards of cord in your pocket, I think?
And my handkerchief, properly rolled, will
make a very good gag. Now over."</p>

<p>They climbed the fence and quietly approached
the house, placing themselves in
the angle of an outhouse out of sight from
the windows. There was no sound, and no
light appeared. Just above the ground about
a foot of window was visible, with a grating
over it, apparently lighting a basement.
Suddenly Hewitt touched his companion's
arm, and pointed toward the window. A
faint rustling sound was perceptible, and as
nearly as could be discerned in the darkness,
some white blind or covering was placed over
the glass from the inside. Then came the
sound of a striking match, and at the side
edge of the window there was a faint streak
of light.</p>

<p>"That's the place," Hewitt whispered.
"Come, we'll make a push for it. You stand
against the wall at one side of the door and
I'll stand at the other, and we'll have him as
he comes out. Quietly, now, and I'll startle
them."</p>

<p>He took a stone from among the rubbish
littering the garden and flung it crashing
through the window. There was a loud
exclamation from within, the blind fell, and
somebody rushed to the back door and flung
it open. Instantly Kentish let fly a heavy
right-hander, and the man went over like a
skittle. In a moment Hewitt was upon him
and the gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Hold him," Hewitt whispered, hurriedly.
"I'll see if there are others."</p>

<p>He peered down through the low window.
Within, Sammy Crockett, his bare legs
dangling from beneath his long overcoat, sat
on a packing-box, leaning with his head on
his hand and his back towards the window.
A guttering candle stood on the mantelpiece,
and the newspaper which had been stretched
across the window lay in scattered sheets
on the floor. No other person besides Sammy
was visible.</p>

<p>They led their prisoner indoors. Young
Kentish recognised him as a public-house
loafer and race-course ruffian well known in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"So it's you, is it, Browdie?" he said.
"I've caught you one hard clump, and I've
half a mind to make it a score more. But
you'll get it pretty warm one way or another,
before this job's forgotten."</p>

<p>Sammy Crockett was overjoyed at his
rescue. He had not been ill-treated, he
explained, but had been thoroughly cowed
by Browdie, who had from time to time
threatened him savagely with an iron bar, by
way of persuading him to quietness and submission.
He had been fed, and had taken
no worse harm than a slight stiffness from his
adventure, due to his light under-attire of
jersey and knee-shorts.</p>

<p>Sergeant Kentish tied Browdie's elbows
firmly together behind, and carried the line
round the ankles, bracing all up tight. Then
he ran a knot from one wrist to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
over the back of the neck, and left the
prisoner, trussed and helpless, on the heap of
straw that had been Sammy's bed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/i_370.jpg" width="625" height="494" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE PRISONER&mdash;TRUSSED AND HELPLESS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You won't be
very jolly, I
expect," Kentish
said, "for some
time. You can't
shout and you can't walk, and I know you
can't untie yourself. You'll get a bit hungry,
too, perhaps, but that'll give you an appetite.
I don't suppose you'll be disturbed till some
time to-morrow, unless our friend Danby
turns up in the meantime. But you can
come along to gaol instead, if you prefer it."</p>

<p>They left him where he lay, and took
Sammy to the old landau. Sammy walked
in slippers, carrying his spiked shoes, hanging
by the lace, in his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Hewitt, "I think I know the
name of the young lady who gave you those
slippers."</p>

<p>Crockett looked ashamed and indignant.
"Yes," he said; "they've done me nicely
between 'em. But I'll pay her&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" Hewitt said: "you mustn't
talk unkindly of a lady, you know. Get
into this carriage, and we'll take you home.
We'll see if I can tell you your adventures
without making a mistake. First, you had
a note from Miss Webb, telling you that
you were mistaken in supposing she had
slighted you, and that as a matter of fact she
had quite done with somebody else&mdash;left
him&mdash;of whom you were jealous. Isn't
that so?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," young Crockett answered,
blushing deeply under the carriage-lamp: "but
I don't see how you come to know that."</p>

<p>"Then she went on to ask you to get rid
of Steggles on Thursday afternoon for a
few minutes, and
speak to her in the
back lane. Now,
your running
pumps, with their
thin soles, almost
like paper, no heels
and long spikes,
hurt your feet horribly
if you walk
on hard ground,
don't they?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that they
do&mdash;enough to
cripple you. I'd
never go on much
hard ground with
'em."</p>

<p>"They're not
like cricket shoes,
I see."</p>

<p>"Not a bit.
Cricket shoes you
can walk anywhere
in."</p>

<p>"Well, she knew
this&mdash;I think I know who told her&mdash;and she
promised to bring you a new pair of slippers,
and to throw them over the fence for you to
come out in."</p>

<p>"I s'pose she's been tellin' you all this?"
Crockett said, mournfully. "You couldn't
ha' seen the letter&mdash;I saw her tear it up and
put the bits in her pocket. She asked me
for it in the lane, in case Steggles saw it."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, you sent Steggles
away, and the slippers did come over, and
you went into the lane. You walked with
her as far as the road at the end, and then
you were seized and gagged, and put into a
carriage."</p>

<p>"That was Browdie did that," said
Crockett, "and another chap I don't know.
But&mdash;why, this is Padfield High Street!" He
looked through the window and regarded the
familiar shops with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Where did you think it
was?"</p>

<p>"Why, where was that place you found me
in?"</p>

<p>"Granville Road, Padfield. I suppose
they told you you were in another town?"</p>

<p>"Told me it was Newstead Hatch. They
drove for about three or four hours, and kept
me down on the floor between the seats so
as I couldn't see where we was going."</p>

<p>"Done for two reasons," said Hewitt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
"First, to mystify you, and prevent any
discovery of the people directing the conspiracy;
and, second, to be able to put you
indoors at night and unobserved. Well, I
think I have told you all you know yourself
now as far as the carriage.</p>

<p>"But there is the 'Hare and Hounds' just
in front. We'll pull up here and I'll get out
and see if the coast is clear. I fancy Mr.
Kentish would rather you came in unnoticed."</p>

<p>In a few seconds Hewitt was back, and
Crockett was conveyed indoors by a side
entrance. Hewitt's instructions to the landlord
were few but emphatic. "Don't tell
Steggles about it," he said; "make an excuse
to get rid of him, and send him out of the
house. Take Crockett into some other bedroom,
not his own, and let your son look
after him. Then come here, and I'll tell you
all about it."</p>

<p>Sammy Crockett was undergoing a heavy
grooming with white embrocation at the
hands of Sergeant Kentish, when the landlord
returned to Hewitt. "Does Danby
know you've got him?" he asked. "How
did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Danby doesn't know yet, and with luck
he won't know till he sees Crockett running
to-morrow. The man who has sold you is
Steggles."</p>

<p>"Steggles?"</p>

<p>"Steggles it is. At the very first, when
Steggles rushed in to report Sammy Crockett
missing, I suspected him. You didn't, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. He's always been considered a
straight man, and he looked as startled as
anybody."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must say he acted it very well.
But there was something suspicious in his
story. What did he say? Crockett had
remarked a chilliness, and asked for a
sweater, which Steggles went to fetch. Now,
just think. You understand these things.
Would any trainer who knew his business
(as Steggles does) have gone to bring out a
sweater for his man to change for his jersey
in the open air, at the very time the man was
complaining of chilliness? Of course not.
He would have taken his man indoors again
and let him change there under shelter.
Then supposing Steggles had really been
surprised at missing Crockett, wouldn't he
have looked about, found the gate open, and
<i>told</i> you it was open, when he first came in?
He said nothing of that&mdash;we found the gate
open for ourselves. So that from the beginning,
I had a certain opinion of Steggles."</p>

<p>"What you say seems pretty plain now,
although it didn't strike me at the time.
But if Steggles was selling us, why couldn't
he have drugged the lad? That would have
been a deal simpler."</p>

<p>"Because Steggles is a good trainer and
has a certain reputation to keep up. It
would have done him no good to have
had a runner drugged while under his care&mdash;certainly
it would have cooked his goose
with <i>you</i>. It was much the safer thing to
connive at kidnapping. That put all the
active work into other hands, and left him
safe, even if the trick failed. Now you remember
that we traced the prints of
Crockett's spiked shoes to within a couple of
yards of the fence, and that there they ceased
suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You said it looked as though he
had flown up into the air; and so it did."</p>

<p>"But I was sure that it was by that gate
that Crockett had left, and by no other. He
couldn't have got through the house without
being seen, and there was no other way&mdash;let
alone the evidence of the unbolted gate.
Therefore, as the footprints ceased where
they did, and were not repeated anywhere in
the lane, I knew that he had taken his spiked
shoes off&mdash;probably changed them for something
else, because a runner anxious as to
his chances would never risk walking on bare
feet, with a chance of cutting them. Ordinary,
broad, smooth-soled slippers would
leave no impression on the coarse cinders
bordering the track, and nothing short of
spiked shoes would leave a mark on the hard
path in the lane behind. The spike tracks
were leading, not directly toward the door,
but in the direction of the fence, when they
stopped&mdash;somebody had handed, or thrown,
the slippers over the fence and he had
changed them on the spot. The enemy had
calculated upon the spikes leaving a track in
the lane that might lead us in our search,
and had arranged accordingly.</p>

<p>"So far, so good. I could see no footprints
near the gate in the lane. You will
remember that I sent Steggles off to watch at
the Cop before I went out to the back&mdash;merely,
of course, to get him out of the way.
I went out into the lane, leaving you behind,
and walked its whole length, first toward the
Old Kilns and then back toward the road.
I found nothing to help me except these
small pieces of paper&mdash;which are here in my
pocket-book, by-the-bye. Of course, this
'mmy' might have meant '"Jimmy' or
'Tommy,' as possibly as 'Sammy,' but they
were not to be rejected on that account.
Certainly Crockett had been decoyed out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
your ground, not taken by force, or there
would have been marks of a scuffle
in the cinders. And as his request for
a sweater was probably an excuse&mdash;because
it was not at all a cold afternoon
he must have previously designed
going out&mdash;inference, a letter received: and
here were pieces of a letter. Now, in the light
of what I have said, look at these pieces. First
there is the 'mmy'&mdash;that I have dealt with.
Then, see this 'throw them ov'&mdash;clearly
a part of 'throw them
over'; exactly what had probably
been done with the slippers.
Then the 'poor f,' coming just
on the line before, and seen,
by joining up with this other
piece, might easily be a reference
to 'poor feet.' These
coincidences, one on the other,
went far to establish the identity
of the letter, and to confirm my
previous impressions. But then
there is something else. Two
other pieces evidently mean
'left him,' and 'right away'&mdash;send
Steggles 'right away,' perhaps;
but there is another,
containing almost all of the
words 'hate his,' with the
word 'hate' underlined. Now,
who writes 'hate' with the
emphasis of underscoring&mdash;- who
but a woman? The writing is
large and not very regular; it
might easily be that of a half-educated
woman. Here was
something more&mdash;Sammy had been enticed
away by a woman.</p>

<p>"Now, I remembered that when we went
into the tap-room on Wednesday, some of
his companions were chaffing Crockett about
a certain Nancy Webb, and the chaff went
home, as was plain to see. The woman, then,
who could most easily entice Sammy Crockett
away was Nancy Webb. I resolved to find
who Nancy Webb was and learn more of her.</p>

<p>"Meantime I took a look at the road at
the end of the lane. It was damper than the
lane, being lower, and overhung by trees.
There were many wheel tracks, but only one
set that turned in the road and went back the
way it came&mdash;- towards the town&mdash;and they
were narrow wheels, carriage wheels. Crockett
tells me now that they drove him about for a
long time before shutting him up&mdash;probably
the inconvenience of taking him straight to
the hiding-place didn't strike them when they
first drove off.</p>

<p>"A few inquiries soon set me in the
direction of the 'Plough' and Miss Nancy
Webb. I had the curiosity to look round
the place as I approached, and there, in the
garden behind the house, were Steggles
and the young lady in earnest confabulation!</p>

<p>"Every conjecture became a certainty.
Steggles was the lover of whom Crockett was
jealous, and he had employed the girl to
bring Sammy out. I watched Steggles home,
and gave you a hint to keep him there.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/i_372.jpg" width="599" height="592" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"STEGGLES AND THE YOUNG LADY IN EARNEST CONFABULATION."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"But the thing that remained was to find
Steggles's employer in this business. I was
glad to be in when Danby called&mdash;he came,
of course, to hear if you would blurt out anything,
and to learn, if possible, what steps you
were taking. He failed. By way of making
assurance doubly sure, I took a short walk
this morning in the character of a deaf gentleman,
and got Miss Webb to write me a direction
that comprised three of the words on
these scraps of paper&mdash;'left,' 'right,' and
'lane'&mdash;see, they correspond, the peculiar
'f's,' 't's,' and all.</p>

<p>"Now, I felt perfectly sure that Steggles
would go for his pay to-day. In the first
place, I knew that people mixed up with
shady transactions in professional pedestrianism
are not apt to trust one another far&mdash;they
know better. Therefore, Steggles
wouldn't have had his bribe first. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
would take care to get it before the Saturday
heats were run, because once they were
over the thing was done, and the principal
conspirator might have refused to pay up,
and Steggles couldn't have helped himself.
Again I hinted he should not go out till I
could follow him, and this afternoon when
he went, follow him I did. I saw him go
into Danby's house by the side way and come
away again. Danby it was, then, who had
arranged the business; and nobody was more
likely, considering his large pecuniary stake
against Crockett's winning this race.</p>

<p>"But now, how to find Crockett? I made
up my mind he wouldn't be in Danby's own
house&mdash;that would be a deal too risky, with
servants about, and so on. I saw that Danby
was a builder, and had three shops to let&mdash;it
was on a paper before his house. What more
likely prison than an empty house? I knocked
at Danby's door and asked for the keys of
those shops. I couldn't have them. The
servant told me Danby was out (a manifest
lie, for I had just seen him), and that nobody
could see the shops till Monday. But I got
out of her the address of the shops, and that
was all I wanted at the time.</p>

<p>"Now, why was nobody to see those shops
till Monday? The interval was suspicious&mdash;just
enough to enable Crockett to be sent
away again and cast loose after the Saturday
racing, supposing him to be kept in one of
the empty buildings. I went off at once and
looked at the shops, forming my conclusions
as to which would be the most likely for
Danby's purpose. Here I had another
confirmation of my ideas. A poor, half-bankrupt
baker in one of the shops had, by
the bills, the custody of a set of keys; but
<i>he</i>, too, told me I couldn't have them; Danby
had taken them away&mdash;and on Thursday, the
very day&mdash;with some trivial excuse, and
hadn't brought them back. That was all
I wanted, or could expect in the way of
guidance; the whole thing was plain. The
rest you know all about."</p>

<p>"Well, you're certainly as smart as they
give you credit for, I must say. But suppose
Danby had taken down his 'to let' notice,
what would you have done then?"</p>

<p>"We had our course even then. We
should have gone to Danby, astounded
him by telling him all about his little
games, terrorized him with threats of the
law, and made him throw up his hand
and send Crockett back. But as it is,
you see, he doesn't know at this moment&mdash;probably
won't know till to-morrow afternoon&mdash;that
the lad is safe and sound here.
You will probably use the interval to make
him pay for losing the game&mdash;by some of
the ingenious financial devices you are no
doubt familiar with."</p>

<p>"Aye, that I will. He'll give any price
against Crockett now, so long as the bet
don't come direct from me."</p>

<p>"But about Crockett, now," Hewitt went
on. "Won't this confinement be likely to
have damaged his speed for a day or two?"</p>

<p>"Ah, perhaps," the landlord replied:
"but, bless ye, that won't matter. There's
four more in his heat to-morrow. Two I
know aren't tryers, and the other two I can
hold in at a couple of quid apiece any
day. The third round and final won't be till
to-morrow week, and he'll be as fit as ever by
then. It's as safe as ever it was. How much
are you going to have on? I'll lump it on
for you safe enough. This is a chance not
to be missed&mdash;it's picking money up."</p>

<p>"Thank you: I don't think I'll have
anything to do with it. This professional
pedestrian business doesn't seem a pretty
one at all. I don't call myself a moralist,
but, if you'll excuse my saying so, the thing
is scarcely the game I care to pick up money
at in any way."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well, if you think so, I won't
persuade ye, though I don't think so much
of your smartness as I did, after that. Still,
we won't quarrel&mdash;you've done me a mighty
good turn, that I must say, and I only feel I
aren't level without doing something to pay
the debt. Come, now, you've got your trade
as I've got mine. Let me have the bill, and
I'll pay it like a lord, and feel a deal more
pleased than if you made a favour of it&mdash;not
that I'm above a favour, of course. But
I'd prefer paying, and that's a fact."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you have paid," Hewitt said,
with a smile. "You paid in advance. It
was a bargain, wasn't it, that I should do
your business if you would help me in mine?
Very well, a bargain's a bargain, and we've
both performed our parts. And you mustn't
be offended at what I said just now."</p>

<p>"That I won't. But as to that Raggy
Steggles, once those heats are over to-morrow,
I'll &mdash;&mdash; well &mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on the following Sunday week that
Martin Hewitt, in his rooms in London,
turned over his paper and read, under the
head "Padfield Annual 135 Yards Handicap,"
this announcement: "Final Heat: Crockett,
first; Willis, second; Trewby, third: Owen, 0;
Howell, 0. A runaway win by nearly three
yards."</p>

<h2><a name="ZIG-ZAGS_AT_THE_ZOO" id="ZIG-ZAGS_AT_THE_ZOO">ZIG-ZAGS AT THE ZOO</a></h2>


<p>By Arthur Morrison
and
J A Shepherd</p></div>
</div>


<h3>XXII.&mdash;ZIG-ZAG SAURIAN.</h3>

<p>People, as a rule, are not
fond of lizards, and the larger
the lizards the less people like
them; until the crocodile and
the alligator, largest of all, are
received with positive antipathy, and
rarely treated as pets. People make
many excuses for such an attitude
toward lizards; calling them ugly,
crawly, slimy, scaly, and so forth. I
have an hypothesis that envy is a
large element in this human
antipathy. For after all, if
we will but confess it, the alligator's
is rather an enviable lot.
To lie all day in a bed of warm,
soft mud&mdash;really, it is a pleasant
thing. To be able, without inconvenience,
to postpone dinner for a fortnight&mdash;that is
attractively economical. To enjoy the
advantages of six eyelids and the resulting
capability in winks&mdash;there is something
even in this. But chiefly, envy for the
crocodile has got into the grain of humanity
by heredity from those ancients who believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
everything that Plutarch told them in his book, <i>De Iside
et Osiride</i>. The crocodile, he informs us therein, can
render itself invisible at will, everything else being perfectly
visible to it the while. This is a noble privilege,
and worthy of the most respectful envy. Jack the Giant
Killer performed the trick by means of a cloak; but
Plutarch's crocodile does it "merely by the power of
the heye," as the street-corner mesmerist has it&mdash;does it
"like winking," in fact. The mechanism is very simple,
and quite easy to understand.
It consists only of
a membrane to draw over
the eye; and as the eye
it is drawn over is the
crocodile's, it is obvious
that he becomes invisible
at once. His
ability to see others is provided for by the ingenious
expedient of having the membrane transparent&mdash;and
there you are. What could be simpler? Anybody
who can run to a transparent membrane fitting for his
eyes may dodge his creditors at will, thanks to the tip
of the benevolent and ingenious Plutarch.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SHORT FROCKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the reptile-house at these Gardens, the largest
saurian bears the apt name of Little-'un. He is a
youthful alligator, although, being rather more than
10 ft. 6 in.
long, he has quite grown out of short frocks.
Nothing infantile remains about his appearance,
and he has in full development that curious
cravat of fleshy folds and creases noticeable in
no animals but alligators and 'bus-drivers, and
among the latter species only in the stout and
red-faced variety. Little-'un's name was not
given him by way of a joke, but because, nine
years ago, he was
only a foot long&mdash;which
<i>is</i> little for
an alligator.
Little-'un has always
been a good
business alligator,
however, and by
strict industry and
invincible perseverance
in the
pursuit of whatever
might be eatable,
has risen to an
honoured and
considerable
eminence in
the higher Zoo
circles. To
observe the open countenance of Little-'un
bearing down on a piece of meat that ought
properly to belong to some other alligator, is
to get a sight of a truly original edition of
"Smiles's Self-Help." Little-'un's one moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
principle is&mdash;the
greatest good of the
greatest alligator. His
business maxim is
get something to eat;
honestly, if there is no
other way, but, anyhow,
get it as large as
possible, and as often
as you can. He
would, without the
least bashfulness, proceed
to eat his friends
in the same tank if
Tyrrell (the keeper, whom
you know already) neglected
the commissariat.
Indeed, he once began on
one fellow-lodger, with no
other excuse than opportunity.
Feeding was in
progress, and, in the
scramble and confusion, a
smallish crocodile, lunging
his nose in the direction of
the desired morsel, without
particularly noticing
where that direction led,
found himself up to the
eyes in Little-'un's dental
establishment. Little-'un's
prudent habits rendered
it unlikely that he
would deliberately fling
away anything that Providence
had actually
thrust into his mouth,
even if it were his own
grandfather: and only a
vigorous application of
Tyrrell's pole saved the
crocodile from making a
meal in a sense he didn't
originally intend.</p>

<p>Eighty-five degrees is
the temperature prescribed
for the water here,
and every crocodile is a
thermometer unto himself,
soon showing signs,
notwithstanding his thick
hide, of any variation in
the rate of his gentle
stewing&mdash;Little-'un being
as sensitive as any, in
spite of his assiduous attention
to business.</p>

<p>THE CROCODILE THERMOMETER</p></div>
</div>

<p>With Tyrrell, by the
way, Little-'un is comparatively
affable, for an
alligator. Tyrrell climbs
calmly into the basin,
among its inmates, to swill
and mop it out at the
weekly cleaning, herding
crocodiles and alligators
into a corner by the flourish
of a mop, in a manner
more than disrespectful&mdash;almost
insulting. There is
some mysterious influence
about that mop. Why
should alligators shut their
heads and stand meekly
aside at its potent waggle?
I would never venture
up the Nile without
Tyrrell's mop. With
one wave of that
mystic sceptre I would
assume immediate
sovereignty over all
the crocodiles in
Africa, and drive them
into corners. There is
no withstanding that
mop. If it will intimidate
crocodiles, plainly
it would be successful
with leopards, cobras,
lions, and tigers. If I
could borrow it I would
even try it on the beadle
at the Bank of England,
and if I could wave <i>him</i>
aside with it, I should
know that thenceforth
the world was at my feet;
and I'm afraid Tyrrell
wouldn't get his mop
back.</p>

<p>But I was speaking of
Little-'un: his affability; and
of Tyrrell: his irreverent
familiarity. When Tyrrell
mops out the basin, he finds
it convenient to leave somewhat
under a foot of water
in the bottom for cleaning
purposes, and as this would
be damp (as is water's
nature) to tread in, he calmly
stands on Little-'un's back
and proceeds placidly with
his mopping. To wave an
alligator aside with a mop
is an insult altogether, but
to stand on his back for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
sake of dry shoes is an outrage unutterable.
Little-'un seems a very appropriate name as it
stands, but if ever a time should arrive when
it must be changed, I think, with every respect
and honour to the departed statesman, I should
suggest John Bright. "Mr. Speaker," said an
honourable member, who spoke before he thought,
but whose name I have forgotten, "Mr. Speaker,
the right honourable gentleman" (Mr. Bright)
"accuses me of making allegations. Why, sir,
the right honourable gentleman is the greatest
alligator in this House!" Which is precisely
what Little-'un is now.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>AT NURSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Round at the back, in his private domains,
Tyrrell keeps a crocodile and alligator nursery.
It is a metal box fixed against a wall and holding
about a gallon. Here are all the infants, eight
inches to a foot long, squirming, wriggling, and
struggling, with a lively activity foreign to the
nature of the full-grown alligator. Tyrrell will
plunge his hand into the struggling mass and produce
a handful for your inspection. They are
charming little pets and as ready to bite as if
they were twenty feet long. An alligator may
be pardoned some impatience in growing; if he is to be ten feet and a half long at nine
years of age, there is a deal of lee-way to make up. Most creatures would be discouraged at
being born only to a measurement in inches,
and refuse to grow
at all.</p>

<p>There would appear
to be a sort
of general reluctance
to make a
domestic pet of
the crocodile; it
is not fashionable
now, and nobody seems
anxious to set the <i>mode</i>.
To encourage anybody
who is disposed to distinguish
himself, I may
observe that a crocodile is cheapest
when young. This is doubly fortunate,
because for a less sum you
have a longer run for your money&mdash;the last expression not being
intended in any uncomfortable sense. I believe the usual price of
young crocodiles and alligators, up to a certain size, is a guinea a
linear foot; at any rate, I know you could buy them at that rate of
my old friend Mr. Jamrach, and I have no doubt that the Zoological
Society may be able, from time to time, to spare a foot or two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
alligator at the price. If
you buy a foot&mdash;or a yard,
as the case may be (the
<i>case</i>, of course, will be a
little longer, but that is
unworthy trifling)&mdash;you
must be careful to keep it
in a warm place, in water
at the right temperature, at night as well as
day. Then when it grows to the size of
Little-'un, it
will make an
imposing embellishment
for your entrance-hall,
and useful to receive subscription-collectors. And to
take them inside.</p>

<p>It is a bad thing to generalize in a world containing
China. China upsets everything. If you venture to
put a date to the invention of gunpowder, somebody
is sure to remind you to except China; the same with
printing and everything else. There is nothing China
hasn't got or hasn't had. So that naturally, after
America has many years flaunted and gloried in the
exclusive possession of the broad-nosed alligator as
distinguished from the sharp-snouted crocodile, China,
in the old familiar aggravating way, bobs up serenely
with <i>her</i> alligators&mdash;perfectly authentic and genuine,
and here some of them are, in the small basin. There's
no getting ahead of China.</p>

<p>But Temminck's Snapper is the wonder and gaping-stock
of this house. Bring the most impassive country
cousin, let him sneer at the snakes, lounge past the
lizards, turn up his nose at the tigers, elevate it more
at the elephants, ridicule the rhinoceros, and disparage
the donkeys. Let him do all this, and then confront him with the Snapper. He will
be beaten. "Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;" He will probably refuse to believe the thing alive, and it
certainly looks more like a fine old Paleozoic
Fossil than anything else imaginable. This
is due to the operation of Misdirected
Patience&mdash;a virtue so noticeable
as to demand capital letters.
For the Snapper has been
in this not very large tank
for ten years, and has not
yet become convinced
that there are no fish in
it. Wherefore he laboriously
and patiently
fishes without a moment's
cessation. Fishing,
with him, means
waiting immovably with open
mouth for a fish to come and be
gobbled. He has waited ten years
for a bite, but that is nothing unusual,
as you may try for yourself, if you buy a
rod and line. It is calculated, I believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
that a hundred years more in his present attitude
will be sufficient to fossilize him, when, no doubt,
he will be passed on to the Geological Society.
He has never yet found the need for an individual
name; but I am thinking of suggesting a suitable
combination&mdash;I think it should be Job Walton.</p>

<p>Job is not an emotional person. He never
exhibits enthusiasm, even for fishing. I shouldn't
myself, after ten years' waiting for a bite. There
he floats, with all the mental activity of an ordinary
brick, while visitors come and go, nations are
convulsed, elections, boat-races are decided,
and green weed grows all over his back, but
he doesn't care. "A rolling stone gathers no
moss" is a capital proverb for the guidance of
people who care for moss as a personal adornment.
Job avoids all rolling, in common with
other forms of movement, and is lavishly
rewarded with moss of the greenest, on back,
legs, toes, and tail. Beyond his
patience (a negative sort of virtue,
after all), Job Walton has no particular
personal characteristic
that I can
discover, except extreme
niggardliness
plain and patent in
his face. He has
nothing in the
world to be niggardly
with, except
his moss, but if
he had, he would
make a very un-indulgent
uncle. I
have a theory that Job is not an animal
at all, but a fossilized concretion of
the twin virtues (or what you like to call them), patience and
stinginess; a sort of petrified fungus, produced by the
chemical action consequent on the mingling of the two qualities.
Probably some very shocking old miser (perhaps it was
Scrooge himself) lost all his stinginess at once, just at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
identical moment when some long-suffering person
lost his patience (this was, probably, an angler).
The subtle essences comprising these qualities
met and mingled&mdash;result, a fungus growth, Job
Walton. The same sort of thing occurs a thousand
times a day in the case of toadstools.</p>

how many feet of tongue he really has. It is a
round, whip-lash sort of tongue, like the ant-eater's, and I have a private superstition in both
cases that there actually is no other end to that tongue. The monitor is fond of rats, but
the rats are not at all partial to his society.</p>

<p>Lesueur's Water Lizard is a curious specimen.
He has not been here long, but has already
assumed, on his own nomination, a position of
great responsibility and importance. He is Inspector
of Visitors. He won't have questionable
characters in the reptile-house. When not
actively inspecting, he is watching for his
victims. He observes a visitor approaching.
He is on guard
at once, by
the front
glass of the
case. His aspect is official and stern, his manner
abrupt and peremptory; he is not a lizard to be
trifled with. "Paid your shilling?" he demands,
as plainly as a silent lizard may.
"Got your railway ticket?
Show it." Any respectable
visitor with the fear of the
law before his eyes
will comply at once.
"Where do you live?
Produce your last
water-rate receipt."
He looks you up and down suspiciously.
"Been vaccinated
lately? Date? All right. Pass
along." And he swings abruptly
round to watch for somebody else.</p>

<p>The Australian Bearded Lizard (most quaint lizards
are Australian) is supposed to derive his colloquial name&mdash;the
Jew Lizard&mdash;from his beard. But he has an Israelitish
acquisitiveness of his own, too. He goes about
his shop&mdash;everything he does makes it seem a shop&mdash;and
brings his paw down on one pebble and one twig after
another with an unmistakable air of assertive proprietorship.
"Mine," he intimates,
"mine, every one of them; and
you keep your hands off them,
unless you're ready to do business."
He would pronounce it
"pishnesh" if mere gesture-talk admitted
of it. A little irritation goes a long way
with the Jew lizard. His beard stands
out tremendously, he swells to a rib-threatening
degree, and stands at bay with
open mouth, ready to smite the Philistines
hip and thigh and spoil the Egyptians of
their finger-tips&mdash;let them but come near
enough. But he is a very respectable
lizard, not so lazy as most, and pleasant to
the touch.</p>

<p>He is not so lazy, for instance, as the
chameleon. The chameleon is the slowest
creature alive. If there were a race between a chameleon and a pump, it would be safest
to back the pump. An active little Gallot's lizard was placed here lately, with a pair of
chameleons, but the contrast was so disgraceful to the chameleons that he was removed,
and made to chum with a Gecko, a few cases off. He
absorbed all the rations, too, which was an addition
of injury to insult, although chameleons can always
put off dinner for a month or two without inconvenience.
A chameleon is a sort of
twin. Like other things, he has
two halves; but these halves
are only acquainted with one
another&mdash;not really intimate.
His left-hand side is often asleep while the
right is as wide awake as a chameleon's side
can be. His eyes, also, are quite independent
of one another, and roll in opposite directions as often as not,
so that he would be inconvenient as a Speaker. Everybody
would catch his eye at once and there would be quarrels&mdash;possibly
even fights&mdash;a thing impossible in the House of
Commons as it is. A chameleon never walks, he proceeds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
this way: After a long and
careful deliberation, extending
over half an hour or so, he
proceeds to lift one foot. You
may not be able to see it moving,
but it is moving all the same,
like the hand of a watch. Take
a look round the Gardens and
come back, when, if you have
not been too hurried in your
inspection, you may see the
lifted foot in mid-air, and the
chameleon probably asleep. He
usually takes a nap after any
unusual exertion. In an hour
or two he will wake up, and
proceed to plant that foot, with
proper deliberation, before him.
Then there will be another nap
and a good think, after which
the tail will begin to unwind
from the branch it clings to.
This process, persistently persevered
in for many days, will
carry the intrepid gymnast quite
a number of inches. But a
journey of this sort is an enterprise
rarely ventured on. Chameleons
prefer the less exciting
sport of sitting face to face and
daring each other to mortal
combat, secure in the assurance
that neither will think
of moving toward the other.
They <i>have</i> been known to
fight. A chameleon fight is
an amusement whereunto
neither the Peace Society nor
the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals need
have any objection. No evangelistic
clergyman need incur scandal by
being present, an interested spectator,
at a chameleon fight. The
savage combatants never attempt to
bite. They gaze gravely and seriously
at the surroundings, and at
proper pre-arranged intervals
solemnly dab
their tails
together&mdash;not
hard, nor with
any particular
feeling beyond
a desire to
conduct the
rite with proper
formality and decorum.
It is the
most harmless and
dignified scuffle in the
animal creation.</p>

<h2><a name="My_Diving-Dress" id="My_Diving-Dress"><i>My Diving-Dress.</i></a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By One Who Has Done With It.</span></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_383.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A large</span> part of my life has
been spent in seeking and
experiencing novel sensations.
Precisely what quality of mind
it is that urges me to try
experiments with myself and
other things I do not know positively; but I
firmly believe it to be dauntless intrepidity.
My fond mother, in early days, used to call
it a noble thirst for information, and predicted
for me a life of scientific eminence; other
people have been so ill-natured as to call
it abject imbecility, and to predict an
early grave from a broken neck or a
dynamite explosion, or something equally
sensational and decided. Never mind what
it is. In boyhood's days it led me once up
the chimney, once on a river in a wash-tub,
once down a gravel-pit with a broken head,
and frequently across my father's knee, with
a pain in another place. Since I have arrived
at years of discretion (or greater indiscretion&mdash;just
as you please), it has taken me up in
a balloon, out to sea in a torpedo-boat,
up the Matterhorn (with no guide but a
very general map of
Europe, having the
height of the mountain
marked on it in
very plain figures),
along Cheapside on
a bicycle at mid-day,
to a football match
in the capacity of
referee, and lastly,
and most recently,
down under water in
a diving-dress. Many
of these experiences
were sharp enough
while they lasted, and
the diving was as disturbing
as most; but,
still, I believe nothing
was quite so uncomfortable
as the football
referee-ship.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_383b.jpg" width="480" height="570" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"MY DIVING-DRESS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>But, just now, I
am concerned only
with the diving. I
have been now and again to Whitstable,
where, I believe by some remarkable
process of Nature, every third male person
is born a diver. Anyway, Whitstable is
the place where divers mostly grow, and
where I caught the temptation to go a-diving
myself. I should feel grateful to any obliging
Anarchist who would blow up Whitstable to-morrow.</p>

<p>I mentioned my desire to one or two
old divers who had permitted me to
make their acquaintance in consideration
of a suitable succession of drinks, but
met with jeers and suspicion. I believe
they were afraid of opposition in the
business. But Whitstable never produced
a diver that could put me off. I took the
royal road. I bought a diving-dress for
myself&mdash;how much I paid I shall not say
here, for why should an unsympathetic world
measure my lunacy by pounds, shillings, and
pence?&mdash;especially as that would make rather
a long measurement of it. Never mind what
I paid. I got the dress, and I also got permission
to go down and amuse myself on a
sunken coasting
vessel lying off Shoeburyness.</p>

<p>It was a very noble
diving-suit, and the
new india-rubber
squeaked musically
as I moved, and
smelt very refreshing.
There was a shield-shaped
plate, rather
like a label on a
decanter, hanging on
my chest, that would
have looked more
complete with
"Whisky," or some
similar inscription, on
it. There was a
noble metal collar&mdash;about
thirty-two, the
size would have been,
on the usual scale. I
had also a very fetching
red night-cap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
while my helmet was a terror to all
beholders. I don't mind confessing to a
certain amount of discomfort while they
were building me up in this dress&mdash;partly
due to a vivid imagination. The helmet
made me think of the people in the story
who put hot-pots on the heads of strangers,
and I seemed stifling at once. What if I
were unpacked at last from this smelly
integument&mdash;a corpse? But this was unmanly
and un-diver-like. There wasn't much
comfort to be got out of the leaden shoes&mdash;try
a pair for yourself and see&mdash;but when all
was ready I made a shift to get overboard
and down the ladder provided. It was not a
great deal of the outer world that I could see
through my windows, and I hung on to
that ladder with something of a desperate
clutch. When at last the water stretched
away level around my windows, then, I
confess, I hesitated for a moment. But
I made the next step with a certain involuntary
blink, and I was under water.
All the heaviness&mdash;or most of it&mdash;had gone
out of my feet, and all my movements
partook of a curiously easy yet slowish
character. It looked rather dark below me,
and I tried to remember the specific gravity
of the human body in figures by way of
keeping jolly. At the top of my helmet
the air-escape-valve bubbled genially, and
I tried to think of myself as rather a fine
figure of a monster among the fish, with a plume
of bubbles waving over my head. You do think
of trivial things on
certain cheerful occasions.
Remember
Fagin in the dock,
for instance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"IN THE HOLD WERE AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF BARRELS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was not as long
as it seemed before
I was on the wreck,
and down below in
the nearest hold.
Regular professionals
had already been at
work, and access to
different parts of the
ship had been made
easy. Now, in this big
hold was an immense
number of barrels,
stood on end and
packed tightly together&mdash;barrels
of oil,
to judge from externals.
I tried to
move one, but plainly
they were all jammed
tightly together, and not one would
shift. I took the light axe with which I had
furnished myself, using it alternately as wedge
and lever, and at last felt the barrel move. I
had certainly loosened it, and pulled up the
axe with the intention of trying to lift the
barrel, when I was suddenly engulfed in
an awful convulsion as of many earthquakes
in a free fight. The world was
a mob of bouncing
oil-barrels, which hit
me everywhere as I
floundered in intricate
somersaults, and finally
found myself
staggering at the
bottom of the hold,
and staring at the
roof, whereunto all
the barrels were sticking
like balloons,
absolutely blocking
up the hatchway
above me.</p>

<p>What was this?
Some demoniac
practical joke of
fiends inhabiting this
awful green sea about
me? Were they
grinning at me from
corners of the hold?
or had some vast
revolution in the ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
of Nature taken place in a second, and the
law of gravity been reversed? It was not
at all warm down there, but I perspired
violently. Then a notion flashed upon
me. Those barrels must have been
<i>empty</i>. Jammed together, they stayed
below, of course, but once the jam was
loosened they would fly at once towards
the surface. Then I thought more. I
had been an ass. Of course, those barrels
would do as they had done, even were
they full of oil. Oil floats on water, as
anybody should know. They might be either
full or empty, it didn't matter a bit. I had
forgotten that I was moving in a different
element from the air I was used to, where
barrels of oil did <i>not</i> incontinently fly up
into space without warning. Obviously, I
had made a fool of myself, but I had some
comfort in the reflection that there was
nobody about to see it. Then it came upon
me suddenly that I would rather have someone
there after all, for I was helpless! Those
horrible barrels were having another jam in
the hatchway now, and my retreat was cut off
entirely. Here I was like a rat in a cage, boxed
in on every side. My communication-cord
and my air-pipe led up between the barrels,
to outer safety; but what of that? I perspired
again. What would happen to me
now? Why did I ever make a submarine
Guy Fawkes of myself, and thus go fooling
about, where I had no business, at the end of a
flexible gas-pipe? If I could have dated myself
back an hour at that
moment, I believe I
should have changed
my mind about going
in for this amusement.
At this, I began
thinking about trivial
things again&mdash;how,
paraphrasing a certain
definition of
angling, diving might
be described as
matter of a pipe
with a pump at one
end and something
rather worse than a
fool at the other.
I determined, if ever
I got out alive, to
fire off that epigram
at the earliest possible
moment&mdash;so
here it is.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/i_385.jpg" width="422" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I HACKED AWAY VICIOUSLY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I made an effort,
pulled myself together,
and determined on heroic measures.
My axe lay near, and, with a little groping, I
found it. I would hew my way out of this
difficulty through the side of the vessel. I
turned on the inoffensive timbers at my side
and hacked away viciously&mdash;with, I really fancy,
a certain touch of that wild, stern, unholy joy
that anyone feels who is smashing somebody
else's property with no prospect of having to
pay for it. Every boy with a catapult, who
lives near an empty house, will understand
the feeling I mean&mdash;especially if the empty
house has a large conservatory.</p>

<p>The timbers were certainly stout. The
work was a bit curious to the senses&mdash;the axe
feeling to work with a deal more dash and go
than the arm that directed it. At any rate, the
exercise was pretty hard. Any millionaire in
want of an excellent, healthy, and expensive
exercise should try chopping his way through
the sides of ships&mdash;it will do him a world of
good, and will be as expensive as anybody
could possibly desire. After a while I found
I had well started a plank, and, once through,
chopping away round the hole was not so
difficult. Still, when I had a hole big enough
to get through, I did not feel by any means
as fresh as I had done when first that horrible
copper pot was screwed down over my head.</p>

<p>I squeezed through the hole, and at the
first step I had ever made on the real sea-bottom,
I fell a savage and complicated
cropper over my communication-cord. I got
up, but, as I stepped clear of the cord, a
frightful conviction
seized my mind that
I was a bigger fool
than I had ever
given myself credit
for being. What in
the world was the
good of getting out
through the side of
the vessel when that
communication cord&mdash;my
only means of
signalling&mdash;and that
air-pipe&mdash;my only
means of submarine
life&mdash;led up through
the boat itself and
among those execrated
oil-barrels?
Awful! Awful! I
sat down helplessly
on a broken rock
and stared blankly
through my windows.
To weep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
would have been mere bravado, with so
much salt water already about me. I tried
to signal with the communication-cord, but
it was caught somewhere in that congregation
of oil-barrels. It seemed to be all up, except
myself, who was all down, with no prospect
of ever rising in the world again. Shadowy
forms came and went in the water
about me, and I speculated desperately
in how long or how short a time these
sea-creatures would be having a dinner-party,
with <i>me</i> as the chief attraction. I
wondered, casually, whether the india-rubber
would agree with them, and hoped that it
would not. Then I wondered what they
would take for the indigestion, and I thought
they would probably take each other&mdash;it's
their way, I believe. I was wandering on
in this way, and had just feebly recollected
that there was four pounds eight and something
in my pockets above, which was a pity,
because I might have spent it first, and
that I owed my landlady fifteen-and-six, which
was a good job, because it would compensate
for that claret she said the cat drank, when
an inspiration seized me&mdash;a great inspiration.
I should probably have called out "Eureka!"
as did the venerable discoverer of that
principle of specific gravity that had lately
(literally) taken a rise out of me, if I had
thought of it, but I didn't, which was
fortunate, because it is rather a chestnut
after all.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/i_386a.jpg" width="402" height="485" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"AWFUL!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>This was my notion&mdash;a desperate one, but
still one with hope in it. I would shut off
the air-escape valve on my helmet, so that
the air being pumped in would inflate my
india-rubber dress like a bladder. Then I
would cut my air-pipe and communication
cord, stuffing the pipe and tying it as best I
might, take off my leaden shoes and rise to
the surface triumphantly, like an air-cushion,
or, say, an oil barrel. Specific gravity having
taken a rise&mdash;all the rise&mdash;out of me, I would
proceed to take a rise out of specific gravity;
a great, glorious, and effective rise to the
upper world. No office-boy on promotion
ever looked forward to his rise with more
hope than I to mine. It was a desperate
expedient certainly, but what else to do?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/i_386b.jpg" width="429" height="513" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I TOOK OFF ONE LEADEN SHOE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I took off one leaden shoe and loosened
the other, ready to kick away. I shut the
escape-valve. I cut the cord with my axe
on the rock I had been sitting on, and then,
when the air had blown out my dress to most
corpulent proportions, I took the decisive stroke.
I chopped through the air-pipe. I stuffed it
as well as possible and tied it in some sort
of a knot&mdash;it was <i>very</i> stiff&mdash;in a great hurry,
and then&mdash;I kicked off the leaden shoe.</p>

<p>Never, never, never&mdash;even if I live on
Jupiter after this planet is blown to shivers&mdash;shall
I forget the result of my forlorn-hope
dodge. I kicked off the shoe, as I have said,
and, in an instant, the whole universe of
waters turned upside down and swirled away
beyond my head. In sober fact, <i>I</i> had
turned upside down&mdash;as I might have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
I should do, if only I hadn't been a bigger
fool than ever.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i_387a.jpg" width="437" height="520" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I HAD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course, the moment my leaden shoes
went, <i>down</i> came my copper head-pot, being
my heaviest part, and up went my feet. I had
a pretty quick rise, certainly, but I prefer not
to recall my feelings
during the rush. I
can quite understand
now why a rise in
the world makes
some people giddy.
All that I had before
felt of amazement and horror, I now
felt multiplied by fifty and squeezed into
about two seconds, so that they felt
like ten hours. Up through that awful
water and those moving shadows I went,
feeling that I was in reality held still,
like a man in a nightmare. When at last I
stopped, I felt that it was but a matter of
moments, and the air would leak away
through that cut tube, and I should go down
again, still head under, for the last time,
to die in that grisly combination of
mackintosh and copper kettle; also I felt
choking, stifling, when&mdash;something had me
roughly by the ankle, and I was dragged, a
wretched rag of misplaced ambition, into a
boat. The appearance of my legs sticking
out above water had, it seemed, caused
intense amusement among the boat's crew&mdash;a
circumstance which probably ought to have
gratified me, although it didn't.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 501px;">
<img src="images/i_387b.jpg" width="501" height="596" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have little more to add, except that I
shudder, to this day, whenever I see an
acrobat standing on his head, because it is
so graphically remindful. But, if anybody is
thinking of going in for diving by way of
placid enjoyment, I shall be delighted to treat
with him for the sale and purchase of a most
desirable diving-dress in unsoiled condition,
cut in the most fashionable style, with a
fascinating copper helmet and commodious
collar, and a neat
label for the chest.
The shoes will not
be included in the
bargain, having been
inadvertently left in
a damp place.</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_BEHIND_THE_SPEAKERS_CHAIR" id="FROM_BEHIND_THE_SPEAKERS_CHAIR"><i>FROM BEHIND THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR.</i></a></h2>

<h3>XIII.</h3>


<p class="center">(VIEWED BY HENRY W. LUCY.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE
EMPTY
SEAT.</div>

<p>The new Session is already
fairly advanced, and in some
sense it is sad to reflect that
business goes forward very much
as if Mr. Gladstone were still in his place by
the brass-bound box. It seemed when the
first announcement of his retirement was
made that the House of Commons could
scarcely survive the withdrawal. There is
not a man in the House to-day who remembers
the place when Mr. Gladstone
was not a prominent figure in it. It is true
Mr. Villiers, having continuously sat since he
was first elected for Wolverhampton in 1835,
is known as "The Father of the House."
But in a Parliamentary sense Mr. Gladstone
was born before his father, seeing that he
took his seat for Newark in the year 1832.
Moreover, whilst Mr. Villiers, literally bent
under the weight of his more than ninety
years, has long withdrawn from regular
attendance on Parliamentary duties, Mr.
Gladstone was, up to the end of last
Session, daily in his place, actively directing
affairs and ready at a moment's notice to
deliver a speech which, standing alone,
would make a Parliamentary reputation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_388.jpg" width="480" height="568" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"LISTENING."</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LISTENING.</div>

<p>Up to the last his passion for Parliamentary
life was overmastering.
He was, probably, never so happy
as when seated in the House following a
debate. Some speeches, to others unbearably
blank of interest, were
to him irresistibly
attractive. During the
last Parliament he, in
deference to an undertaking
extorted by Sir
Andrew Clark, promised
to limit his regular
attendance on
debate up to a point
marked by the dinner-hour,
not returning save
upon exceptional occasions.
He made up for
restraint of opportunity
by exacting use of the
measure provided.
Often between seven
and eight o'clock, when
the House was almost
empty and some unimportant,
unattractive
member found his
chance, he had among his scanty audience the
Prime Minister, sitting with hand to ear,
apparently entranced. During the interminable
Home Rule debates, Mr. Gladstone
formed a habit, at which less excitable members
used to smile, of moving to the gangway-end
of the Treasury Bench, sitting there
by the hour eagerly listening to a member
whose measure of attraction for ordinary
men was indicated by the emptiness of the
benches. When in Opposition he carried
this habit a step further, occasionally seating
himself below the gangway the better to
hear an Irish member.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE UNDERTAKER.</div>

<p>Although immersed in affairs of
State, Mr. Gladstone had that
intimate personal knowledge of
the House of Commons which
seems more natural among the gossips in
the smoke-room. He knew every man
above the level of the absolutely silent
members, and had formed a keen and
well-defined judgment of their qualities.
He was always on the look-out for promising
young men among his own party, and sometimes
found them, as in the cases of Mr.
Asquith, Mr. Acland, Mr. Robertson, Sir
Edward Grey, and Mr. Sydney Buxton.
One evening during the Midlothian campaign,
the conversation turned upon new
members on the Conservative side who had
made some mark in the last Parliament. I
ventured to name one
Irish member, seated
above the gangway,
who had taken frequent
part in debate
on Irish affairs, and
had shown intimate
knowledge of the Irish
question.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr.
Gladstone, "but his
manner is so funereal.
In my humble way,"
he added, his face
wrinkling into the
smile that illumined it
when he was much
amused, "I call him
the Undertaker."</p>

<p>There was something
charming in this
way of putting it, as
if he were only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
beginner in the way of affixing nicknames
to Parliamentary personages, and must not
be understood in his "humble way" to be
competing with practitioners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAITED.</div>

<p>One feeling that weighed with
everyone when Mr. Gladstone
withdrew from the forefront of
Parliamentary life was that he, the greatest,
is also the last of a type not cast for modern
Parliaments. There was about him in the
heat of battle a certain chivalry of manner,
and in the minutest relationships a courtesy,
which is too truly known as "old-fashioned."
With his departure the House of Commons
loses a standard of daily conduct which,
though unattainable for the average man,
was ever a wholesome incentive. To
gentlemen below the gangway this courtly
bearing under, sometimes, almost brutal provocation,
was an incomprehensible
and undesirable
thing. They wanted to see
him hit back, give stroke
for stroke, and could not
understand his patient,
dignified bearing. No man,
under my observation in
the House of Commons&mdash;and
I have lived in it for
more than twenty years&mdash;was
ever assailed with such
bitterness as Mr. Gladstone;
and none have shown so
little resentment. During
his Ministry of 1880-5,
he was nightly the object
of vituperation on the part
of the Irish members, who
came nearer to the language
of Billingsgate than
of Westminster. It seems
now, as it seemed then,
that no man could ever
forget, or forgive, the savagery of that prolonged
onslaught. I do not know whether
Mr. Gladstone has forgotten it. Certainly,
through the last seven years he sat on one
or other of the Front Benches he comported
himself as if it had never been: as if the men
whom he alluded to as "my hon. friends" had
ever, as then, cooed him as gently as a sucking
dove.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i_389.jpg" width="321" height="518" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"DIGNITY AND COURTESY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In private I have heard him speak of only
two members of the House of Commons with
abhorrence, and then the tone of voice and
visage were terrible to hear and see. When
he has appeared at the table following some
bitter personal attack, and the House has
hushed every sound in expectation of an
avalanche of scathing wrath, he has but
lightly touched on the personal matter, and
returned to the course of argument it had
spitefully broken in upon. Once or twice
last Session he turned upon Mr. Chamberlain,
and delighted the House by the courtly
grace and delightful skill of his reprisal. But
it was never savage, or with any under-current
of nastiness&mdash;which possibly, after all, made
it the more effective.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Cavendish Bentinck was
much treasured by the House of Commons
by reason of the temptation, invariably
irresistible, he laid in the way of Mr. Gladstone
to indulge in lofty banter. Oddly
enough, in these later years, the man who
stirred the blackest water of his ire was Mr.
Jesse Collings, whose almost venerable
inoffensiveness of appearance, as Mr. Gladstone
turned upon him,
completed the enjoyment of
the episode. Mr. Finlay
was another member who
seemed quite inadequately
to stir his wrath. At one
time a promising recruit to
the Liberal party, Mr.
Finlay in 1886 seceded
with Lord Hartington and
Mr. Chamberlain. Like
the other Dissentient
Liberals he retained his
old seat, which happened
to be immediately behind
the Front Opposition
Bench. His contiguity
seemed to affect Mr. Gladstone
with physical repulsion.
In the heat of
debate he would turn
round to face Mr. Finlay,
at the moment innocent of
wrong-doing, fix him with
flaming eye, and pour over him a torrent of
scorching denunciation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONUMENTAL
PATIENCE.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone's marvellous
patience has been shown most
conspicuously in his bearing
towards temporary recalcitrant
followers. For at least a quarter of a century
his worst enemies have been those of his
own household. As soon as he has completed
the structure of a Ministry, so soon have
"caves" been dug around it by hands that
assumed to be friendly. His progress has
ever been clogged by Tea Room cabals, the
incessant unrest culminating in the great
disruption of 1886.</p>

<p>I do not remember seeing Mr. Gladstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
more angry than he was one Wednesday
afternoon in the Session of 1870. Here
again his wrath was excited by an ordinarily
inoffensive person. The Irish Education
Bill was before the House, and there was,
naturally, a Tea Room Party formed by good
Liberals for the destruction of their Leader
and the bringing in of the other side. Mr.
Fawcett was foremost in the cabal, laying the
foundation, after a manner not unfamiliar in
politics, of the Ministerial position he later
attained under the statesman whom he had
attacked from the flank. Mr. Miall, in genial
Nonconformist fashion, accused Mr. Gladstone
of profiting by the support of the Opposition,
thus earning the suspicion, distrust, and
antagonism of his most earnest supporters.</p>

<p>By an odd coincidence, Mr. Miall sat that
afternoon in the very seat where last year
Mr. Gladstone was accustomed to find Mr.
Chamberlain. When he sat down the Premier
leaped to his feet and, turning upon him with
angry gesture, as if he would sweep him
bodily out of the House, said: "I hope my
hon. friend will not continue his support of
the Government one moment longer than he
deems it consistent with his sense of duty
and right. For God's sake, sir, let him withdraw
it the moment he thinks it better for
the cause he has at heart that he should
do so."</p>

<p>Twenty-four years have sped since that
Wednesday afternoon. But I can see, as if
it were yesterday, the figure with outstretched
hand, and hear the thunderous voice in
which this never since repeated invocation to
the Deity rang through the House. The
outbreak was memorable because rare. Since
then the provocation has been as persistent
as that which on this same Irish Education
Bill prepared for the foundering of the
Liberal party in the earliest months of 1874,
and led to all that came to pass in the next
six years of the Disraeli Parliament. Occasionally
Mr. Gladstone has been moved to
outburst of resentment. But it has been
slight compared with the incentive.</p>

<p>We have heard and read in recent months
much about the courage, eloquence, and
statesmanship of this great career. To me
it seems that the most strongly marked
feature in it has been its quiet long suffering,
its sublime patience. The fight is finished
now, well done up to the very last, and
to-day&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">YOUTH
AND AGE.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is so accustomed
to make passing references to his
extreme age, and those in close
intercourse with him have grown
so habituated to the phenomenon, that the
marvel of it comes to be considerably
lessened. There are two personal recollections
which serve to place the fact in full
light. One was revived by Sir William Harcourt
at one of the Saturday-to-Monday
parties with which the Prince of Wales
occasionally brightens Sandringham. A reference
to the Premier's then approaching eighty-fourth
birthday being made, Sir William Harcourt
said he had a perfect recollection of an
occasion when he was nursed on the
knee of Mr. Gladstone. Sir William is
no chicken, either in years or girth, and
recollection of this affecting scene carried
him back nearly sixty years. It was too
much for Mr. Frank Lockwood, who happened
to be amongst the guests forming this particular
house party. Through eyes softened
with the gleam of tears, the Recorder of
Sheffield sketched on the back of the menu a
picture of the infantile Harcourt fondled on
the knee of his right hon. friend, both unconscious
of all the coming years held in
store for them. The sketch is, I believe,
now among the prized possessions of the
Princess of Wales.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>OLD WILLIAM AND YOUNG WILLIAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The other reminiscence also belongs to the
records of a country house, and it is Mr.
Gladstone who recalls it. Mr. Henry Chaplin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
was a fellow guest. Mr. Gladstone one evening
asked him whether his grandmother had not
lived in a certain street in Mayfair. Mr. Chaplin
assented. "Ah," said Mr. Gladstone, "I
remember it very well. I lived next door to
her for awhile when I was a child. She used
to give evening parties. When the carriages
were assembled to take up, my brother
and I used to creep out of bed&mdash;it was in
the summer time&mdash;softly open the window,
get out our squirts, and discreetly fire away
at the coachmen on the boxes. I remember
the intense delight with which we
used to see them look up to the sky and
call out to ask each other whether it wasn't
beginning to rain."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;">

<div class="caption"><p>SIR ISAAC HOLDEN.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SIR
ISAAC
HOLDEN.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is not, after all,
the oldest man in the present
House of Commons. Sir Isaac
Holden is his senior by two
years. Of the twain, I fancy Sir Isaac is
the younger-looking. During the winter
Session, lacking the impulse of the constant
fight round the Home Rule standard,
disappointed by the success of Obstructionist
tactics, Mr. Gladstone, from time to time,
showed a distinct falling-off from the splendid
form he had presented through the long summer
Session. Sometimes he sat on the Treasury
Bench, with chin sunk on his chest, a
grey paleness stealing over his face, and the
light of battle faded from his eyes. He
never failed to pull himself together on returning
to the House after a division. But
the effort was made, not, as heretofore, in
advance of his entrance, but after he had
walked a few paces, with bent shoulders and
weary gait.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Holden, who has now entered on
his eighty-seventh year, is as straight as a dart,
and walks with springy step that shows no
effort. He shares with Mr. Gladstone the
characteristic, rare in a man of fourscore,
that his eyes are still bright and clear. On
occasions when the Standing Orders are suspended
and the House sits late in anticipation
of an important division, Sir Isaac waits
till whatever hour is necessary in order to
record his vote. When the House is up, he
walks home.</p>

<p>Unlike Mr. Gladstone, Sir Isaac has leisure,
means, and disposition to order his daily life
upon carefully-considered rules. His day is
automatically parcelled out: work, exercise,
food, and recreation each having its appointed
place and period. He is neither a vegetarian
nor a teetotaler, though the main stock of
his daily meals is fruit and vegetables. For
wine he drinks a little claret. He has lived
a busy, useful life, and owes a large fortune
to his own industry and enterprise. Of
singularly modest disposition, the only thing
he thinks worthy of being mentioned to his
credit is the fact that he invented the lucifer
match.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EFFACEMENT
OF
THE IRISH
MEMBER.</div>

<p>The still new Parliament possesses
no more marked characteristic
than the self-effacement
of the Irish member. If any
member of the 1874 or the
1880 Parliament were to revisit Westminster
without knowledge of what had taken place
since 1886, he would not recognise the scene.
In those not distant days the Irish member
pervaded the Chamber. Whatever the
subject-matter of debate might be, he was
sure to march in and make the question
his own. If in any direct or indirect manner
Ireland was concerned, this was natural
enough. But any subject, found in China or
Peru, would serve to occupy a night's sitting,
and retard the progress of Government
business. In the Parliament of 1880 two of
the most prolonged and fiercest debates,
inaugurated and carried on by the Irish
members, related to flogging in the army
and the state of affairs in South Africa.</p>

<p>This procedure was, up to 1886, part of a
deliberate policy, of which Mr. Biggar and
Mr. Parnell were the earliest exponents.
They wanted their own Parliament on College
Green. If the Saxon, regardless of entreaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
and demands, insisted on keeping them at
Westminster, they would make themselves as
obnoxious as possible. The habit of
constantly taking part in debate being thus
formed, and fitting easily gentlemen to whom
public speaking comes by nature, it was
observed, though with less persistence, during
the last Parliament, when the Irish party was
no longer a political Ishmael, but was the
acknowledged ally of one of the great English
armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR.
SEXTON.</div>

<p>With the opening of the present
Session a marvellous, almost
miraculous, change has been
wrought. Its most remarkable
development, the fullest measure of rare
personal sacrifice, is found in the case of Mr.
Sexton. A man of rare gifts as a debater, no
one takes so keen a pleasure in the
delivery of Mr. Sexton's speeches as does
the hon. member himself. This very
excess of appreciation was at one time
wont to mar his Parliamentary position.
For the ordinary speaker, provision of one
peroration per speech suffices. So illimitable
are Mr. Sexton's natural resources, that he
can toss off half-a-dozen perorations in the
course of a single speech. In practice this
habit grows a trifle tantalizing. Even the
most indolent listener draws himself together
and concentrates
attention when a
member, who has
been talking for
twenty minutes or
half an hour, shows
signs of coming
to a conclusion.
When, after declaiming
a ringing
peroration, the
orator, recurring to
leveller tones and
less ornate style,
quietly begins
again, the feeling
of disappointment
is aggravated by
a sense of having
been betrayed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_392.jpg" width="250" height="549" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MR. SEXTON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In some of his
set speeches, extending
from one
and a half to two
hours, Mr. Sexton,
doubtless unconsciously, has been known
thus to impose on the confidence of the
House three distinct times. This long-irresistible
tendency to verbosity was regrettable
as spoiling a position won by natural
ability, hampered rather than assisted by
adventitious circumstances.</p>

<p>Since the first Session of the new Parliament
opened the Irish members, including
Mr. Sexton, have conducted themselves in
a manner that testifies to the potency of
patriotism. The one object they have in
view is to get a Home Rule Bill added to
the Statute Book. It is avowedly, as Lord
Randolph Churchill long ago, with brusque
frankness, admitted, a race against time.
Every week's delay in the accomplishment
of the end imperils the success of the movement.
In these circumstances any Irish
member who lengthens the proceeding by
speech-making is a traitor to the cause. The
Irish members have, therefore, with one
accord taken and kept a vow of silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RADICAL
MARTYRS.</div>

<p>This is no new thing in
Parliamentary tactics. A dozen
years ago a similar effacement of
another active party was brought
about in the House of Commons. This was
the active and useful private member, of
whom the late Mr. Peter Rylands was a type,
accustomed to sit through Committee of
Supply worrying the Minister in charge of
the Votes with innumerable questions and
pin-pricking criticisms. The Irish were then
the Obstructionists, and, taking full advantage
of opportunity presented in Committee of
Supply, they talked at large through the
night in order to prevent Votes being taken.
It came to pass that any honest, well-meaning
member who desired to obtain information
touching a particular Vote came to be
regarded as a criminal. He was undoubtedly
by his interposition playing the game of the
Obstructionists. It was not only the time
appropriated by his remarks that had to be
taken into account. The quick-witted Irishmen,
making the most of every opportunity,
went off on the new trail opened, and followed
it for the greater part of a sitting. The well-meaning
economist was shunned by his
friends, frowned on by his leaders, and took
care not to repeat the indiscretion. Between
1880 and 1885 the old-fashioned custom of
narrowly examining the Civil Service Estimates,
not the least interesting function of a
member of the House of Commons, received
a blow from which it has not yet recovered.</p>

<p>The consequent self-repression was bad
enough for sober Saxons like Mr. Peter
Rylands and his mates in Committee. For
the Celtic nature the strain must be much
more severe. What Mr. Sexton suffers, as
night after night he sits below the Gangway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
hearing other members talk and recognising
how much better he could put the points,
who shall say? As for Mr. Tim Healy, he
providentially finds partial relief in a running
commentary that occasionally draws upon
him reproof from the Speaker or Chairman.
Mr. Balfour, with the instincts of a leader
partially responsible for good order in the
House, once welcomed these little ebullitions.
They were, he said, equivalent to the blowing-off
of steam. Shut off the means of partial
relief, and fatal explosion might follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE
EXTINCT
IRISH
MEMBER.</div>

<p>It is curious but not inexplicable
how the type of Irish member
familiar eighteen or even thirteen
years ago has disappeared. Of
the band Isaac Butt reappeared
on the political stage to lead, but few are left.
Even of their successors, the body Mr.
Biggar inspired and Mr. Parnell organized,
those still in the House may be counted on
the fingers of one
hand. And what a
rare group of individuals
they formed!
There were many
characters that might
have stepped out of
the pages of Lever
or Lover. Butt himself
was an interesting
figure, a relic of Parliamentary
time and
manner that to-day
seem prehistoric. It
is a pity that such
a man, with his great
gifts and his wide
experience, should
have been allowed
to drop behind the
horizon without the
tribute of that biography
rendered to many far less interesting
and important people. There was something
pathetic about the renunciation of his leadership
by the party he had created. When Parnell
was a youth at college, Butt was fighting for
Home Rule for Ireland. He was the Moses
of this Irish pilgrimage. Some failings and
shortcomings may have justified the edict
which forbade him to enter the Promised
Land. But it was a little hard that he
should have been ousted from the command
whilst still on the march he had
planned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/i_393.jpg" width="488" height="484" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MR. TIM HEALY.</p>

<p><i>From an Irish MS. of the 19th Century.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>I remember the night when, entering the
House whilst the usual flood of questions
was pouring from the Irish camp, he walked
on, crossed the Gangway, and took his seat
behind the Front Opposition Bench. He
did not long survive this severance from the
majority of his party. He was not old as
years are counted. But he had lived his
days, had heard the chimes at midnight, was
bowed in body, harassed in mind, and this
last blow shattered him.</p>

<p>There were few to migrate with him above
the Gangway. Almost alone, McCarthy
Downing followed the old leader, a lachrymose
comforter, sitting near him, as Butt, with his
back turned to the Irish quarter, sat with his
head leaning on his hands listening to the
shrill gibes of Joseph Gillis, or the more
polished but not therefore less acrid taunts
of Parnell.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell Henry was one of the few
who stood by the old chief, the rift thus
developed widening as the influence of
Parnell and Biggar prevailed, and open war
was declared against
law and order and the
House of Commons.
When the Liberals
came in in 1880, and
the Irish members,
breaking through a
new tradition, decided
to remain stationary
on the left of the
Speaker, Mitchell
Henry crossed the
floor, sat with the
Ministerialists, and
became a favourite target
of the Parnellites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR
PATRICK
O'BRIEN.</div>

<p>With him
went Sir
Patrick
O'Brien,
the most delightful
embodiment of
genuine Irish humour of the unconscious, inconsequential
order known to the present
generation. Sir Pat, with his left hand in
his trousers pocket, his right hand shaking
defiance at his countrymen opposite, was a
precious possession, for ever lost to an
increasingly prosaic Parliament. He could
not away with the new kind of Irish member
represented by Mr. Kenny, "the young sea-sarpent
from County Clare," as in a flight of
lofty but vague eloquence he called him.
"Order! order!" cried the Speaker, sternly.
"Then, Mr. Speaker," said Sir Pat, with a
courtly bow, "I will withdraw the sea-sarpent
and substitute the hon. member for County
Clare."</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_394.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the October of 1890 I went
to pay a short visit to my
friends, the Brabazons, of Penporran,
in Cornwall. I could
only spare a week out of town,
and looked forward to my visit
with the pleasure which a busy man must feel
when he can relax his labours for a short time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/i_394.jpg" width="487" height="393" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WE HAD MANY MEMORIES TO REVIVE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Brabazon was an old college friend, and on
the first evening of my stay we had many
memories to revive and many friends to
talk over. We sat until the small hours
in his smoking-room, and it was early morning
before we retired to bed. Just as I was
leaving the room, he said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the way, you will find some disturbing
elements at work here. I know you are fond
of attributing everything to some psychological
cause. I wonder what you will say to the
love affairs of Randall, Carleton, and Miss
Farnham."</p>

<p>I naturally asked what my host meant.</p>

<p>"Randall and Carleton are both desperately
in love with the same girl," he
replied. "Did you not notice the state of
affairs this evening at dinner?"</p>

<p>"I naturally noticed Miss Farnham," I
answered at once. "It would be difficult not
to be attracted by so striking a personality."</p>

<p>"Barbara Farnham is, without exception,
the most dangerous girl of my acquaintance,"
replied Brabazon, with a slight laugh.
"Before her advent on the scene, Randall
and Carleton were the best possible friends.
Now they are at daggers drawn."</p>

<p>"I confess I did not particularly observe
them," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are just ordinary good young
fellows," replied Brabazon. "I am sorry for
Carleton, of course, for I don't think he has
the ghost of a chance with Miss
Farnham. He is not particularly
good looking, and he has the misfortune
to be poor. Randall is a
handsome lad, and has considerable
expectations. His father is
Lord Hartmore&mdash;but the
fact is, I don't think the
girl means to marry either
of them&mdash;she is simply
playing one against the
other for her own ends.
She is a handsome witch,
and a dangerous one.
She plays as carelessly
with edged tools&mdash;as carelessly
and unconcernedly
as a baby would with its
rattle."</p>

<p>I said nothing further.
Brabazon conducted me
to my room, and wished
me good-night. I sat
down by the fire, and
thought in an idle manner
over the events of the evening. There was
a large house party at Penporran. Shooting
was going on vigorously, and cub-hunting
had begun. Some of the guests were acquaintances
of mine. In short, I looked forward
to a pleasant week in this genial house. As
I laid my head on my pillow I thought again,
but without any specially keen interest, of
Brabazon's story about the disturbing
elements which were now agitating the air of
this otherwise peaceful mansion.</p>

<p>Two young men were in love with the
same girl. Surely the situation was a very
ordinary one. Such a complication happened
daily.</p>

<p>I wondered why Brabazon should have
troubled himself to mention such an ordinary
event, but as I was dropping off to sleep, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
saw rising up before me, in my mind's eye,
the proud, beautiful face of Barbara Farnham,
and a kind of intuition told me that
these commonplace incidents might assume
the form of tragedy in her cruel and careless
hands.</p>

<p>I dreamt of Miss Farnham that night, and
came down to breakfast the next morning
with my curiosity considerably aroused about
her.</p>

<p>She was in the room when I entered, and
was idly helping herself to a cup of coffee,
which she carried to a distant window where
a small table was also laid for breakfast.
She sat down, and, sipping it leisurely, looked
around her with a careless glance. Her eyes
fell on me&mdash;she smiled and motioned to me
to approach.</p>

<p>"Pray bring your breakfast to this table,"
she said, in a light tone. "I was immensely
interested in you when I heard you were
coming. I adore doctors, particularly if they
are clever. Are you going to ride this
morning?"</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative, and asked
her if she was fond of horses.</p>

<p>"Fond?" she replied, a flash of added
warmth lighting up her peculiar red-brown
eyes. "I am going to whisper a secret to
you&mdash;I never could compare horses and
human beings. I consider the horse the
infinitely nobler creature of the two."</p>

<p>I laughed, and we entered into an animated
conversation.</p>

<p>While we were talking, Carleton came into
the room. He was a squarely built young
man, with deeply set dark eyes, and a determined
chin and mouth. His figure was
slightly above the middle height; he was
extremely spare, but had good shoulders and
was well set up. As soon as ever he appeared
in sight, Miss Farnham, by an almost imperceptible
movement, slightly turned her back
to him and her talk with me became even
more animated and full of wit than before.
Her gay, light laugh must have reached
Carleton, who came straight across the room
to her side.</p>

<p>"You are in your favourite seat," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "and Dr. Halifax is
having breakfast with me."</p>

<p>Then she turned to continue her conversation
with me, while Carleton stood perfectly
erect and silent by her side.</p>

<p>"Why don't you eat something?" she
said to him, presently.</p>

<p>"There is time enough," he answered.</p>

<p>Finding he would not go away she tried
to draw him into conversation, but he was
evidently not in the humour to make himself
agreeable. His answers were confined to
monosyllables, and to some of Miss Farnham's
remarks he did not reply at all.</p>

<p>I confess that I began to think him an
unmitigated bore.</p>

<p>A change was, however, quickly to take
place in the situation&mdash;Randall, the other
lover, appeared on the scene, and his coming
acted like a flash of sunshine. He was
a gay, handsome, debonair-looking young
fellow. He had good teeth, good eyes, a
genial smile, a hearty manner. His voice
was musical, and he knew well how to use
it. He nodded carelessly to one or two
acquaintances when he entered the room, and
then came straight to Miss Farnham's table.</p>

<p>She shook hands with him, and he nodded
a cheerful good morning to Carleton and me.</p>

<p>"That is right," he said, smiling brightly
at the handsome girl; "you promised to reserve
a seat for me at this table, and I see
you have kept your word. Have you done
breakfast, Carleton?"</p>

<p>"I had something an hour ago," replied
Carleton.</p>

<p>Randall went to a sideboard to help
himself to a generous portion of a dish
which was being kept hot with a spirit lamp.
On his return our conversation became gayer
and more lively than ever.</p>

<p>I must confess that I saw nothing to object
to in Miss Farnham's manners. I could not
imagine why Brabazon spoke of her as a
dangerous witch. She tried to be polite
to both men&mdash;or rather, she was polite
without effort, but there was not a trace of
the flippant in her manner or bearing. Her
beauty was undoubtedly of a remarkable
order. Her eyes were her most striking
characteristic. There was a great deal of red
in their brown, which was further accentuated
by the red brown of her long eyelashes. The
eyes were capable of every shade of expression,
and could be at times as eloquent and as full
of meaning as those of that bewitching creature,
the collie. Her eyebrows were dark
and delicately pencilled. Her hair was
tawny in shade&mdash;she had quantities of
it, and she wore it picturesquely round
her stately, statuesque head. In some lights
that brilliantly coloured hair looked as if
a sunbeam had been imprisoned in it. Her
complexion was of a warm, creamy whiteness.
Her figure was slight and graceful. But for
her eyes she might have been simply
remarked as a handsome girl; but those eyes
made her beautiful, and lifted her completely
out of the commonplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>We had nearly finished breakfast, when I was
startled by seeing Randall suddenly press his
hand to his eyes, and turn so white that I
thought he was going to lose consciousness.
He recovered himself almost immediately,
however, and so completely, that no one else
remarked the circumstance. Miss Farnham
rose from the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"I am going to ride with you, Dr. Halifax,"
she said, nodding brightly to me. "I shall
come downstairs in my habit in half an hour."</p>

<p>She was crossing the room to speak to
some of the other guests when Carleton came
up to her.</p>

<p>"I want to say something to you," he
said&mdash;"can we go to some room where we
shall be quite undisturbed?"</p>

<p>His words were distinctly audible, not
only to me, but to several other people in
the room.</p>

<p>Randall in particular heard them, and I
could see that he was waiting anxiously for
the reply.</p>

<p>"I want to ride this morning. I have no
time for private confidences," replied Miss
Farnham, in a distinctly vexed tone.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you long," replied Carleton&mdash;"what
I have to say is of great importance,
at least to me."</p>

<p>"I will give you ten minutes after lunch;
will that suffice?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes now will do better. I am
very much in earnest when I make this
request."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Miss Farnham, in a light
tone; "importunate people generally have
their way. Come into the conservatory&mdash;there
is a rose there on which I have set my
heart; it is too high for me to reach."</p>

<p>She left the room as she spoke, and Carleton
quickly followed her. As they disappeared,
I noticed more than one guest
looking significantly after them. Carleton's
pluck was distinctly approved of&mdash;I could see
that by the expression on some of the ladies'
faces and one, as she passed close to
Randall's side, was heard to murmur,
audibly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faint heart never won fair lady."</p>

<p>Randall came up to me and asked me to
join him in a smoke on the balcony.
As we walked up and down, he talked
cheerfully, and, whatever anxiety he may
inwardly have felt, was careful not to betray
a trace of it.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour Miss Farnham
joined us. She was in a dark brown riding-habit,
which toned perfectly with her rich
and peculiar colouring. Her spirits were
gay, not to say wild, and the warm, creamy
whiteness of her face seemed to glow now
as if with hidden fire.</p>

<p>"Are you not ready for your ride?" she
said, looking at me with a certain reproach.
"The horses will be round in less than ten
minutes. It is a splendid morning for a
gallop. You are coming, too?" she added,
turning suddenly to Randall.</p>

<p>"I only waited for you to invite me,"
he said. "Of course I shall come, with
pleasure. But I thought," he added, in a
low tone, coming close to her side as he
spoke, "that you arranged to ride with
Ronald Carleton this morning?"</p>

<p>"That is off," she replied, in a light tone.
"Mr. Carleton has, I believe, another
engagement."</p>

<p>The balcony on which we were walking
led round to one of the entrances to the
house; at this moment a groom was seen
leading a smart mare up to the door, and at
the same instant Carleton ran down the
steps, and sprang lightly into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to?" exclaimed
Randall, bending out of the balcony to
speak to him. "Miss Farnham, Dr. Halifax,
and I are all going out immediately. Won't
you join us?"</p>

<p>"Not this morning, I think," said Carleton,
constraint in his tone. He gathered
up the reins, and the mare began to prance
about.</p>

<p>"You are holding her too much on the
curb," exclaimed Randall.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I think I know what I'm about,"
replied Carleton, with evident temper.
"Quiet, you brute, quiet," he continued, vainly
endeavouring to restrain the movements of
the impatient animal.</p>

<p>"I tell you, that mare won't stand the
curb," shouted Randall. "Give her her
head, and she'll do anything you ask her. I
know, for I've often ridden her."</p>

<p>"When I require a riding lesson from you,
I'll inform you of the fact," answered Carleton,
in a sulky voice, which was rendered
almost ridiculous by the frantic movements
of the mare, now thoroughly upset.</p>

<p>Miss Farnham, who had been standing in
the background, came up at this juncture,
and took her place conspicuously by Randall's
side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randall is right and you are wrong,"
she exclaimed. "It is absolutely cruel to
ride that mare on the curb."</p>

<p>Carleton looked up with a scowl, which
anything but improved him. He would not
even glance at Miss Farnham, but his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
flashed an angry fire at his more fortunate
rival.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/i_397.jpg" width="481" height="625" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"CARLETON LOOKED UP WITH A SCOWL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Of course, Randall is right," he exclaimed.
"All the odds are in his favour."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," retorted Randall, with heat.</p>

<p>"Come, come, gentlemen, pray don't
quarrel on this lovely morning," said Miss
Farnham. "Mr. Carleton, I wish you a
pleasant ride."</p>

<p>She left the balcony as she spoke, and
Randall and I immediately followed her
example.</p>

<p>We had a splendid ride over an extensive
moorland country, and returned to lunch in
excellent spirits and in high good humour
with each other. Carleton had not yet
come back, but his absence did not seem
to depress anyone, certainly not Miss
Farnham, whose bright eyes and gay, animated
manner made her the life of the
party. Randall was radiant in the sunshine
of her presence. She was confidential and
almost affectionate in her manner to him:
and he undoubtedly looked, and was, at
his best.</p>

<p>I could not help cordially liking him and
thinking that the pair were well matched.
Notwithstanding Brabazon's words of the
night before, I had no doubt that Miss
Farnham was sincerely attached to
Randall, and would tell him so
presently.</p>

<p>I spent the greater part of the
afternoon alone with my host, and
did not see the rest of the guests
until we met at dinner. Carleton
had then returned. He sat between
a red-haired girl and a very fat old
lady, and looked as <i>distrait</i> and
bored as man well could. Randall,
on the other hand, was in his best
form. His clothes sat well on him.
He was, undoubtedly, a handsome,
striking-looking man.</p>

<p>I cannot describe Miss Farnham's
dress. It was ethereal in
texture and suited her well. She
was not seated in the neighbourhood
of either Randall or Carleton,
but once or twice I noticed
that her eyes wandered down to
their part of the table. For some
reason, she was not in such high
spirits as she had been in the early
part of the day. My neighbour, a
quiet, middle-aged spinster, began
suddenly to talk to me about her.</p>

<p>"I see you are interested in
Barbara Farnham," she began. "I
am not the least surprised&mdash;you but follow
the example of all the other men who know
her."</p>

<p>"Miss Farnham is a very beautiful girl."
I replied.</p>

<p>Miss Derrick gave a short sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "Barbara has a
beautiful face. She is a fine creature too,
although of course terribly spoilt."</p>

<p>"Have you known her long?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; since she was a child. Of course
you must notice, Dr. Halifax, the state of
matters. Barbara's conduct is more or less
the talk of the whole house. I presume
from his manner that poor Mr. Carleton's
chances of success are quite over, and
for my part I am sorry. He is not rich,
but he is a good fellow&mdash;he is devotedly
attached to Barbara, and his abilities are
quite above the average. Yes, I am sorry for
Mr. Carleton. Barbara might have done
worse than return his affection."</p>

<p>I did not feel inclined to pursue the subject
any further with this somewhat garrulous
lady. After a pause, I remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Farnham looks tired, and does not
seem in her usual spirits."</p>

<p>Miss Derrick shrugged her thin shoulders.</p>

<p>"What else can you expect?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
answered. "Barbara is a creature of moods.
She was quite <i>exalt&eacute;e</i> all the morning; now
she will be correspondingly dull, until a
fresh wave of excitement raises her spirits."</p>

<p>At this moment the signal for the ladies
to withdraw was given. After their departure,
Carleton and Randall found themselves
sitting close together. I noticed that neither
man spoke to the other, and also observed that
after a time Carleton deliberately changed
his seat for one at a distant part of the table.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i_398.jpg" width="578" height="557" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"CARLETON DELIBERATELY CHANGED HIS SEAT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We did not sit long over wine, and when
we came into the drawing-room a lady was
playing some classical music with precision
and sufficient brilliancy to attract several
musical men to the vicinity of the piano.
Her place was quickly taken by the droll
man of the party, who entertained the
company with comic songs. The evening
dragged on in the usual manner. For some
unaccountable reason no one seemed quite
in good spirits. As for me, I found myself
constantly looking in the direction of the
door. I heartily wished that either Carleton
or Randall would come in&mdash;I acknowledged
to myself that the presence of one at least
of these gentlemen in the room would give
me relief.</p>

<p>An hour and more passed away, however,
and neither of them appeared. I glanced
towards Miss Farnham. She was standing
near the piano, idly playing with a large
feather fan. I thought I read both solicitude
and expectation in her eyes.</p>

<p>The funny man was trolling out a sea-song
to which a lively chorus was attached.
Brabazon came up and touched my arm.</p>

<p>"When that is over," he said, in a low
voice, "I will ask Barbara Farnham to
sing."</p>

<p>"Can she sing?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Can she!" he reiterated. "Yes, she
sings," he replied, emphatically. "Wait&mdash;you
will hear her in a moment. Her voice
is the most absolutely sympathetic I have
ever listened to."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Miss
Farnham went to the piano.
She played her own accompaniment.
One grand
sweep her hands seemed
to take of the instrument,
as if they meant to embrace
it, and then a voice, high,
full, sweet, magnificent in
its volume of melody, rose
on the air and seemed to
fill the room.</p>

<p>Brabazon was right, Barbara
Farnham could sing.
As the words fell from her
lips, there was no other
sound in the listening
room.</p>

<p>I jotted those words down
afterwards from memory&mdash;they
seemed to me to be
a fit prelude to the scene
which was immediately to
follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou hast filled me a golden cup<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a drink divine that glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the bloom that is flowing up<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the heart of the folded rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grapes in their amber glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the strength of the blood-red wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All mingle and change and flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In this golden cup of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the scent of the curling wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the balm of the rose's breath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the voice of love is thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thine is the Song of Death!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The voice of the singer sank low as she
approached the end of her song. The final
words were in a minor key. I looked full at
Miss Farnham, and her dark eyes met mine.
They were full of apprehension. A kind of
premonition of coming sorrow might well
have filled her breast from the look in their
depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a noise and sense of confusion
in the outer drawing-room. People stood
back to make way for someone, and hurrying
steps came quickly towards the piano.</p>

<p>Miss Farnham sprang to her feet, the last
notes of the song arrested on her lips.</p>

<p>Carleton, an overcoat covering his evening
dress, his hair dishevelled, his eyes wild, had
come hastily to her side.</p>

<p>"You will think that I have killed him,
Barbara; but, before God, it is not true!" he
said in a hoarse whisper&mdash;then he grasped
my arm.</p>

<p>"Come, I want you," he said, and he
dragged me, as if he were a young fury, out
of the room.</p>

<p>"What, in the name of Heaven, is the
matter?" I asked of him when we found
ourselves in the hall.</p>

<p>"Randall has fallen over the cliff down by
Porran's field," he gasped. "I have found
the&mdash;the body. Oh! no, no, what am I
saying? Not the body yet&mdash;not a body
when I left it&mdash;it breathed&mdash;it just breathed
when I left. I tried to drag it up here, but
it was too heavy. Come at once, for the love
of Heaven."</p>

<p>Other people had followed us out of the
drawing-room. I encountered a glance of
fire from Miss Farnham's dark eyes&mdash;her face
was like death itself. Brabazon, in a tone
full of authority, as befitted the host, began
to speak.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "Accident or no, there
is not a moment to
be lost in trying to
help the poor fellow.
You will lead us to
the spot at once,
Carleton. Come,
Halifax; what a blessing
that you happen
to be on the spot!"</p>

<p>"Get some brandy
and something which
we can improvise into
a litter or shutter," I
exclaimed. "I am
going to my room
to fetch my surgical
case."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 554px;">
<img src="images/i_399.jpg" width="554" height="436" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I FELT FOR THE PULSE IN THE LIMP AND POWERLESS WRIST."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I ran upstairs.
A moment or two
later we were on
our way to the
scene of the accident.
Every man
of the party accompanied
us, and
several of the ladies. The foremost of the
group was Miss Farnham herself. She had
hastily flung a shawl over her head, and the
train of her rich dinner dress was slung
across her arm. She looked at Carleton,
and with a peremptory gesture seemed to
invite him to come to her side. He did so,
and they rushed on&mdash;too quickly for many of
the rest of the party to keep up with them.</p>

<p>It was a bright, moonlight night, and we
had scarcely any need of the lantern which
Brabazon was thoughtful enough to bring
with him. We had to go some distance to
reach the spot where poor Randall was
lying, but by-and-by we found him stretched
partly on his back, partly rolled over on his
left side, on a little strip of sand which
gleamed cold in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was here I left him," exclaimed
Carleton. He fell on his knees as he spoke
and looked intently into the poor lad's face.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed, looking up
at me, "he can't be dead. I dragged him as
far as this, and then left him lying on his back.
See, he has moved&mdash;he is partly on his side
now!"</p>

<p>I motioned to Carleton to make way for
me to approach. I felt for the pulse in
the limp and powerless wrist. I laid my
hand on the heart&mdash;then I gently raised the
head, and felt along the region of the skull.</p>

<p>"You will give him a little brandy,"
exclaimed Brabazon; "here is the flask."</p>

<p>Miss Farnham took it out of Brabazon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
hands, unscrewed it, and began to pour some
into the cup. As she did so, she knelt also
on the sand. I looked at her and felt that
she would probably need the stimulant which
could avail nothing now to the dead.</p>

<p>"It is all over," I said; "he is dead, poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>As I spoke, I stretched out my hand and
took the brandy flask from Miss Farnham.
She looked wildly round, glanced at Carleton,
gave a piercing cry, and fell forward
over Randall's body. She had completely
lost consciousness. I laid her flat on the
sand, and, applying some restoratives, she
quickly came to her senses.</p>

<p>The body of the dead man was lifted up
and laid on some boards which we had
brought with us, and we returned slowly to
the house. Brabazon gave his arm to Miss
Farnham, who truly needed it, for she
staggered as she walked. I looked round
for Carleton. There was a wild expression
in his eyes, which made me anxious about
him. I saw, too, that he wished to linger
behind the others.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, going up to him, "this
has given you a terrible shock; why, you are
just as much overcome as Miss Farnham."</p>

<p>I dragged his hand through my arm, and
we followed in the rear of the sad procession.
All the way up to the house he did not speak,
nor did I trouble him with questions. I saw
that his misery had made him dumb for the
time being&mdash;in short, he was in a stunned condition.
I dreaded, however, the return tide of
strong emotion which must inevitably follow
this apparent calm. I guessed that Carleton
was a man of strong sensibilities. I could read
character well&mdash;most men in my profession
have much practice in this art. The human
eye tells a doctor a good deal. The lips
may falter out certain utterances, which the
eyes will belie. I read truth and sincerity
in the honest eyes of this young man. He
was intensely reserved&mdash;he was jealous to a
morbid degree&mdash;he in all probability possessed
anything but a good temper; nevertheless,
his eyes were honest, and I felt certain
that he had nothing whatever to do with
poor Randall's death. Nevertheless, I knew
well that appearances were strongly against
him.</p>

<p>When we got to the house I turned to him
and said, abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to see you in Brabazon's
smoking-room in about half an hour."</p>

<p>He raised sullen eyes to my face.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, laying my hand on his
shoulder, "I tell you at once I do not believe
that you killed that poor fellow, but we must
talk the matter over. I am anxious to be
your friend. It is absolutely necessary that
you should confide in someone. I am as
unbiased in my views of the whole situation
as man can be. Come and talk to me in
half an hour in the smoking-room."</p>

<p>He did not say a word, but I knew by the
way in which he suddenly grasped my hand
that he would come.</p>

<p>The dead man was carried into the library,
where he was laid reverently on a table.
Brabazon then had a consultation with
me as to the best means of breaking the
news to Lord and Lady Hartmore. Poor
Randall was their only son; it was a terrible
business altogether, and Brabazon was
naturally greatly distressed.</p>

<p>I asked after Miss Farnham. He told me
that she had gone straight to her room. His
tone was scarcely sympathetic, and I looked
at him in wonder.</p>

<p>"I have no patience with her," he exclaimed.
"She has behaved very badly&mdash;this
awful thing would not have occurred but
for her. She has driven poor Carleton&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I put up my hand to arrest the words.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I exclaimed. "You surely
don't&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He laughed aloud in his agitation.</p>

<p>"I surely do," he began. "There, Halifax,
we won't give the thing a name to-night. Of
course, there must be a coroner's inquest."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible thing altogether," continued
Brabazon; "and to think of its happening
here. And to Randall, of all people&mdash;a man
with his expectations. Well, it is a lesson
which Miss Farnham may well lay to heart."</p>

<p>We were standing together in the library&mdash;the
hour was now nearly midnight. The
body of the dead man lay on the centre
table covered with a white sheet. There
came a knock at the door, and to my dismay
and astonishment I saw Carleton enter
the room.</p>

<p>"I heard voices, and guessed you would
be here," he exclaimed. "I have recovered
my nerves to a certain extent, and wish to
tell you, sir," looking at his host, "and you
also, Dr. Halifax, exactly what has occurred."</p>

<p>"Come into the smoking-room," said
Brabazon, not unkindly.</p>

<p>"No," answered the poor lad. "If you
will allow me, I will tell my story here. There
is not much to tell, but what there is had
best be told in the presence of&mdash;&mdash;" his lip
trembled&mdash;he could not get further words
out. He sank suddenly into a chair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
covered his white face with his shaking hands.
"We must humour him," I said, turning
and speaking in a
whisper to Brabazon&mdash;"and
before God," I
continued, impulsively,
"I believe he is as innocent as I am."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/i_401.jpg" width="525" height="536" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE COVERED HIS WHITE FACE WITH HIS SHAKING HANDS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I drew forward a chair for myself as I
spoke, but Brabazon stood by the hearth.</p>

<p>Carleton began to speak almost directly&mdash;his
emotion was quickly mastered.</p>

<p>"I have loved Barbara Farnham for
two years. At intervals she has given
me great encouragement, and I had fair
hopes of winning her until she met Randall
in this house a fortnight ago. This morning
I felt desperate, and resolved to put my
fortunes to the test. I asked her to
give me an interview after breakfast,
as you doubtless noticed." He paused
and looked at me&mdash;I nodded my head,
and he continued: "We went into the conservatory,
and I&mdash;I spoke to her. I told her
the naked truth, perhaps a little too bluntly.
I asked her if she really meant to&mdash;no, I
must not say what I did ask her. It is
unfair&mdash;unfair to her. From her manner
and her words I plainly gathered that she
preferred Randall to me, and that I had no
chance whatever of winning her. Perhaps I
lost my temper&mdash;anyhow, it was unmanly of me
to say what I did. I accused her of valuing
Randall's position. I told her plainly that if
Randall and I could change places, I should
be the favoured one. We had a disagreement;
our interview was full of pain, at least to me.
When I left Miss Farnham the Evil
One seemed to enter into me, and
I hated Randall as I never knew
before that I could hate anyone.
I would not ride with the others, but
went away by myself, and the whole
day has been a long agony to me.</p>

<p>"My hatred to Randall grew
worse and worse, until its vehemence
half frightened me. We
used to be good friends, too.
After dinner I felt that I could
not bear a couple of conventional
hours in the drawing-room,
and went out to nurse
my misery in the open air. I
had no idea that Randall was
also out. I went along by the
shore, but mounted to the
higher cliffs on my way back.
I intended to leave Penporran
early to-morrow, and felt impatient
for the hour when I
could get away from the loathsome
sight of my successful
rival.</p>

<p>"As I was walking along
by the edge of the cliffs,
and had just entered Porran's
field, I felt my heart jump into my
mouth, for Randall was coming to meet
me. He was about a hundred yards away
when I first saw him. He is a taller
man than I, and he seemed to stand
out sharply between me and the sky. I
knew by his attitude that he was smoking a
cigar. I stood still for a moment. I did
not want to pass him. My heart was full
of torment, and I hated to meet him out
there, with not a soul to stand between
us. You know that part of the cliff, Mr.
Brabazon? Randall had just come to that
portion of it which is railed in to keep the
cattle from tumbling over. I don't know
what possessed him to take the outside path,
which is very narrow and slippery. He did
so, however; and now, for the first time, he
must have noticed me. I was within fifty
yards of him, coming also along the edge of
the cliff. He stood stock still, as if something
or somebody had shot him. I thought
he was about to shout to me, but instead of
doing so, he threw up one hand and clutched
his brow. The next instant he began to
sway from side to side, and before I could
approach him, he had fallen over the cliff,
down that awful height!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>"My absolute surprise stunned me for a
moment&mdash;then I ran up to the spot where
he had fallen, and throwing myself on my face
and hands, looked over the cliff, in the hopes
that he might have clung on to something.
The moon was bright, but I could not see
him. Looking down from that height made
me dizzy, and I saw there was nothing for it
but to retrace my steps as fast as possible to
the shore. I ran quickly, and was breathless
when I got up to him. He was lying on his
back, with his arms stretched out&mdash;some
blood was oozing from his mouth. I wiped
it away and called to him, and putting my
arms under his head, tried to lift him. He
moaned and moved faintly. I felt his limbs&mdash;they
seemed all right. I had a wild hope
that he was only stunned, and tried to drag
him along the shore. He was too heavy for
me, however, and I feared that I was only
injuring him in my attempt to get him
back to the house. I laid him as easily
as I could on a piece of sand above
high-water mark, and then ran back to
Penporran. It was on my way back that
the awful idea first occurred to me that
Barbara would think I had killed him. I
seemed to see all the circumstances of his
terrible death with preternatural clearness,
and I felt sure that the gravest suspicion
would attach to me. I have come to this
room now to tell you both, before Heaven,
and in the presence of the dead man, the
solemn truth. Of course, I cannot compel
you to believe me."</p>

<p>Carleton stood up as he uttered these last
words. His attitude was very manly, and the
look on his face was at once straightforward
and quiet. I liked him better than I thought
I ever could have liked him. I felt deep
sympathy for him, and looked at Brabazon,
expecting him to share my sentiments. To
my surprise, however, I saw by the expression
round his lips that he was not favourably
impressed by Carleton, and that his feelings
towards him were the reverse of sympathetic.</p>

<p>Carleton looked full at him, expecting him
to speak. When he did not, the poor fellow
repeated his last remark, a faint quaver
perceptible in his voice:</p>

<p>"Of course, I cannot compel you to
believe me."</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming to see us," said
Brabazon then; "you have been the first to
give name to a suspicion which will, doubtless,
be harboured by more than one person
who has known all the circumstances of this
unhappy case. I sincerely pity you, Carleton,
but I prefer to keep my judgment in
abeyance for the time being. Halifax will
tell you that a coroner's inquest will be
necessary. At the inquest the whole matter
will be gone carefully into. You may be
certain that all possible justice will be done
you."</p>

<p>"Justice!" exclaimed Carleton, a faint
smile playing for an instant round his lips.
"Justice, when there were no witnesses!
Oh, that the dead could speak!" He turned
abruptly and prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>Brabazon called after him.</p>

<p>"You must give me your word of honour
that you will not attempt to leave Penporran
before the inquest."</p>

<p>"You may rest assured on that point."
said Carleton.</p>

<p>He left the room. The restraint he was
putting upon himself gave a dignity to his
whole bearing which impressed me much.</p>

<p>"I fully believe in that poor fellow's
innocence," I said, as soon as the door had
closed behind him. Brabazon gave me a
keen glance.</p>

<p>"You are a good judge of character," he
said, after a pause; "still, I prefer to keep
my judgment in abeyance."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he bade me good-night,
and I retired to my own room. I closed the
door and stood by the hearth, where the
ashes of the fire, which had been lit some
hours previous and had long ago burnt itself
out, were to be seen.</p>

<p>I felt too restless to go to bed, and wished
the morning would come. I was standing so,
thinking over all the circumstances which
had turned our gay party into one of mourning,
when I heard a footfall outside my door.
I thought it might possibly be Carleton, and
going across the room, I opened the door and
went out into the corridor. To my astonishment,
Miss Farnham, still wearing her gay
evening dress, stood before me.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of knocking at your door,"
she said, "but had scarcely courage to do so.
I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"I will see you in the morning," I said.</p>

<p>"It is morning already," she replied.
"This is no time for conventionality, Dr.
Halifax; I wish to speak to you now. You
cannot sleep, and no more can I. Please
follow me to Mrs. Brabazon's sitting-room,
where a fire and a lamp are still burning."</p>

<p>She led the way, and I obeyed her without
a word.</p>

<p>"Now tell me the truth." she said, the
moment we found ourselves in the room.
"Will Mr. Carleton be accused of having
murdered poor Arthur Randall?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that grave suspicion
will attach to him," I answered, without
hesitation.</p>

<p>"But you think him innocent?" she
queried.</p>

<p>"I think him innocent. As innocent as
you or I."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't speak of me," she said, sinking
suddenly on the sofa. "Pray don't mention
my innocence. But for me this tragedy
would never have happened."</p>

<p>I looked long at her before I replied.</p>

<p>"In one sense you may be right," I
answered; "it is quite possible that but for
you Carleton would not have witnessed
Randall's death. Still, you must not be unfair
to yourself&mdash;you are not accountable for the
sudden brain seizure which must have caused
Randall to reel and fall over the cliff."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Carleton has just described the accident
to Brabazon and me," I answered. "He
saw Randall sway and fall over the cliff. I
believe his story, although I fear few people
will agree with me."</p>

<p>"I don't know the story," she said, faintly.
"Pray tell it to me."</p>

<p>I did so in a few words.</p>

<p>"You believe all this?" she
said, with intense eagerness, when
I had done speaking.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How do you account for Mr.
Randall's death?"</p>

<p>I could not help sighing deeply.</p>

<p>"You allude now to the difficulty
of the position," I said. "At the
present moment I cannot account
for Randall's death. A man in
perfect health is not often attacked
with such violent vertigo as to
cause him to lose the power of
keeping himself upright." Then
I paused&mdash;I was thinking deeply.
"Undoubtedly there have been
such cases," I said, "but they are
rare."</p>

<p>I remembered, as I spoke, Randall's
change of colour and the
sudden pressure of his hand to
his head that morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>"You have seen a good deal of
the poor fellow," I said. "Did
he ever at any time complain of
peculiar symptoms to you? Did
you ever notice anything about
him which would lead you not to
suppose him in perfect health?"</p>

<p>"Never," she said at once,
emphatically. "He always seemed to me
to be the perfect embodiment of the rudest
health and strength."</p>

<p>"The death is very mysterious," I said;
"and while I personally believe poor Carleton's
story, I fear matters will go hard with
him."</p>

<p>I was about to leave the room, as I did not
imagine Miss Farnham could have anything
further to say to me, when she exclaimed,
impulsively, her eyes filled with the most
terrible anguish, her face turning white as
death: "If, indeed, this thing is true, and if
Ronald Carleton has to suffer in consequence
of Mr. Randall's death, I shall put an end to
my own life."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I said, sharply. "You must
not speak in that wild way. You know you
don't mean a word that you say."</p>

<p>"You mistake me," she replied. "I
exaggerate nothing. I state a simple fact
when I tell you that if Ronald Carleton
suffers for this, my remorse will be greater
than I can bear. I have behaved badly to
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, God knows you have!" I interrupted.
I felt angry with her, and did not want to
spare her at that moment. "You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
behaved badly to as honest and true-hearted
a man as ever breathed. When will beautiful
women like you learn that men's hearts
are not mere balls to be kicked here and
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are right to abuse me," she
said. "Go on, go on. I am so unhappy
that nothing you can say will add to my pain.
My cup of misery is full. I have ruined
the man I love."</p>

<p>"The man you love?" I queried, looking
at her in astonishment. "Nay, you must
not be too hard on yourself. You surely are
not accountable for Randall's tragic end. If
Carleton's story is true, he died from sudden
vertigo. You were kind to him while he
lived&mdash;you have
nothing to reproach
yourself with on
that score."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have,"
she answered, with
sudden passion. "I
deceived him. I
made him think
that I loved him;
in reality, he was
nothing to me. It
is Ronald Carleton
whom I love."</p>

<p>"Then, in the
name of the Evil
One&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may
well quote the Evil
One," she retorted.
"I think he has
been about the
house all day. I
think he entered
into me this morning
when poor
Ronald spoke to
me. The Evil One held me back then from
telling him what I really thought. I gave him
to understand that I&mdash;I hated him, and all the
time I loved him&mdash;I loved him then&mdash;I love
him now&mdash;I shall love him for ever! The
dead man is nothing to me: less than
nothing!"</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"SHE FLUNG HERSELF ON HER KNEES AT MY FEET."</p></div>
</div>

<p>She began to walk up and down the room:
fever spots burnt on her cheeks; her eyes
looked wild; she clenched her right hand.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" I asked, after
a pause. "You have been good enough to
confide in me: you must have done so for a
reason."</p>

<p>She stopped her restless walk and came
close to me.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you before, Dr. Halifax,"
she said. "This is not the first time you
have been asked to help people in trouble.
I want you to help me&mdash;will you help
me?"</p>

<p>"With all my power, if I can."</p>

<p>"You can. Find out what killed Mr.
Randall. Save Ronald Carleton."</p>

<p>"I wish I could," I said, reflectively.</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't be difficult," she replied.</p>

<p>I looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>To my amazement, she flung herself on
her knees at my feet.</p>

<p>"You can invent something," she said,
clasping my hand and pressing it frantically
between both her own. "Oh, it would not
be a crime&mdash;and it would save a life&mdash;two
lives. Say you saw symptoms of apoplexy.
Say&mdash;oh, you will know what to say&mdash;and
you are a great doctor, and you will be
believed."</p>

<p>"Get up," I said, sternly; "I will forgive
your wild words, for circumstances have
excited you so much that you do not quite
know what you are saying. Believe me that
nothing would give me more sincere satisfaction
than to be able to discover the real
cause of poor Randall's death. But you
mistake your man utterly when you make
the suggestion you do. Now I must leave
you. It is almost morning, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
promised to meet Brabazon downstairs at
an early hour."</p>

<p>I went back to my own room, where I sat
in anxious thought until the time which
Brabazon had appointed for us to meet
arrived. I then went down to the smoking-room,
where I found him.</p>

<p>He looked harassed and ill&mdash;no wonder.
The subject we had met to discuss was how
best the news of their only son's death was
to be broken to Lord and Lady Hartmore.
The Hartmores' place was situated about a
hundred miles away. Brabazon said that
there was nothing whatever for it but to
telegraph the unhappy circumstance to
them.</p>

<p>"And I fear doing so very much," he
added, "for Hartmore is not strong: he has a
rather dangerous heart affection."</p>

<p>"Don't telegraph," I said, impulsively; "I
will go and see them."</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Brabazon. "That would
be an immense relief. You will know how to
break the news in the least startling way. I
should recommend you to see Lady Hartmore
if possible first&mdash;she is a strong-minded
woman, and has a fine character. But, at
best, the shock will be terrible&mdash;it is good of
you, Halifax, to undertake so fearful a
mission."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I replied. "Will you come
with me?"</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot. My wife is very much
shaken, and I ought not to leave her with a
house full of people."</p>

<p>"I suppose most of your guests will leave
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Probably; still, for the time being, they
are here. Then there is the inquest, which
will most likely take place to-day."</p>

<p>"I was going to propose," I said, "that a
post-mortem examination should precede the
inquest."</p>

<p>Brabazon raised his brows&mdash;he looked
annoyed.</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?" he asked&mdash;"a post-mortem
examination will only add needlessly
to the sufferings of the unfortunate parents.
In this case, surely, the cause of death is
clearly defined&mdash;fracture of the skull?"</p>

<p>"The cause of death <i>is</i> clearly defined,"
I answered, "but not the cause of the
sudden vertigo."</p>

<p>"The sudden vertigo, according to
Carleton's account," corrected Brabazon.
He did not say anything further for a
moment&mdash;nor did I. After a pause, he
continued: "As you are good enough to
say you will go to Tregunnel, I will ask you
to take poor Randall's last letter with you.
I went into his room yesterday evening, and
found one directed to his mother on the
writing-table. She will prize it, of course.
Now I had better look up your train."</p>

<p>He did so, and half an hour afterwards
I was driving as fast as a pair of horses
could take me to the nearest railway station.
I caught an early train to Tregunnel, and
arrived there between nine and ten that
morning. A cab conveyed me to the castle,
which stood on a little eminence above the
sleepy-looking town.</p>

<p>My errand was, in truth, a gloomy one.
During the journey I had made up my mind
for every reason to see Lady Hartmore first.
When the servant opened the door, I asked
for her, and giving the man my card, told
him that I wished to see his mistress alone
on a matter of urgent importance. I was
shown into a morning-room, and in a very
short time Lady Hartmore came in. She
was a tall, fine-looking woman, with a likeness
to her dead son about her kindly, well-opened
eyes and pleasant mouth.</p>

<p>My name and the message I had sent to
her by the servant naturally startled her.
She gave me a keen glance when she entered
the room, which I returned with interest.
I saw at once that her heart was strong
enough, her nature brave enough, to stand
the full weight of the terrible calamity without
breaking down.</p>

<p>"I have come to see you on a most
painful matter," I began at once. "I am
just now visiting the Brabazons at Penporran."</p>

<p>"Then it is something about my son,"
she exclaimed, instantly. Her face grew
very pale; she pressed her hand to her
left side, and looked hurriedly towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Lord Hartmore may come in, if you are
not quick," she said. "He was in the
breakfast-room when the servant brought me
your card and message. Please tell what
you have got to say at once&mdash;I can bear a
shock, but he cannot."</p>

<p>Poor wife! poor mother! Her eyes looked
at me with dumb entreaty, while her lips
uttered the words of courage.</p>

<p>"Women like you, Lady Hartmore," I
could not help uttering, impulsively, "are
always brave. It is my terrible mission to
inflict a great blow upon you&mdash;your son has
met with an accident."</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" she asked. She came
close to me as she spoke, her voice had sunk
to a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 533px;">
<img src="images/i_406.jpg" width="533" height="563" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'IS HE DEAD?' SHE ASKED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"He is dead," I
replied, instantly;
"sit down."</p>

<p>I motioned her to a
chair&mdash;she obeyed me.</p>

<p>"Lock the door,"
she said; "Lord Hartmore
must not&mdash;must
not know of this&mdash;quite
yet."</p>

<p>I did what she asked
me, and then went and
stood with my
back to her in
one of the windows.</p>

<p>As I did so
I felt in my
pocket for the
letter which Brabazon
was to
have given me.
It was not there.
I then remembered
that in the
excitement of
my getting off in
time to catch the
train we must both have forgotten it.</p>

<p>After a time Lady Hartmore's voice,
sounding hollow and low, reached my ears.</p>

<p>"Tell me the particulars," she said.</p>

<p>I did so. I sat down near her and told
them as briefly as possible. She listened
attentively. When I had finished she said,
in a puzzled tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot account for the sudden giddiness.
Arthur always had excellent health."
Then she looked me full in the face. "Do
you believe the story, Dr. Halifax?"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment, then I said,
emphatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it."</p>

<p>She did not speak at all for the best part
of a moment. Then she gave a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "the thing that
affects us is the death. He is dead. The
inevitable has overtaken him. It scarcely
matters how it happened&mdash;at least not now&mdash;not
to me."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I interrupted, "it matters a
great deal how it happened. The cause of
your son's death will be a question of anxious
investigation&mdash;of the gravest and most searching
inquiries. I fully believe the story which
Carleton told us last night, but there are
others who will&mdash;who must&mdash;suspect him of
foul play. Is it possible, Lady Hartmore&mdash;is
it in any way within the province of woman,
so completely to forget
herself in this
moment of terrible
anguish, as to live
for another? You
can do nothing now
for the dead, but
you can do much,
very much, for the
living."</p>

<p>"You mean for
my husband?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Not alone
for your husband&mdash;not
even
principally
for him. You
can do much for
the man who
will be accused
of the crime of
having murdered
your son. I
can only repeat
my firm conviction
of his innocence,
but the
grounds for my belief, at present, go for
nothing; circumstances prove a grave case
against him. Your son, to all appearance,
was much attached to the girl whom Carleton
loved and loves. Yesterday morning
Carleton received what he considered a final
rejection from Miss Farnham. She spent
the day with your son; she gave him every
encouragement. Carleton was morose,
gloomy, jealous. His jealousy and gloom
were noticed by every member of our party.
Carleton and your son both absented themselves
from the drawing-room after dinner.
It was during that time that the accident,
which deprived your son of his life, took
place. There will, of course, be a
coroner's inquest. At the inquest the
circumstances which I have just alluded to
will come out, and there is no question but
that Carleton will be arrested on suspicion
and sent to trial&mdash;unless, indeed, you will
help me."</p>

<p>"How can I help you?" she asked.
"What am I to do? You ask me to share
your belief, which seems to me to be based
on nothing. Suppose I cannot share it?"</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I want you to do,"
I said then. "I want you to join me in
insisting on having a post-mortem examination."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave me a glance of horror.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked. "Why must the
sleep of the dead be disturbed?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer her, Lord Hartmore's
voice was heard at the door.</p>

<p>She was a brave woman, but at the sound
of her husband's voice her courage for a
moment deserted her.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how can I break it to him?" she
gasped. "Oh, please, don't leave me."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I will stay with you."</p>

<p>I unlocked the door myself, and a white-headed,
feeble-looking man came querulously
into the room.</p>

<p>His wife rose to meet him. She put her
arms around him and some way, somehow,
conveyed the terrible tidings to his mind.
I need scarcely linger over the hour that
followed. At the end of that time I was
accompanying the Hartmores back to Penporran.
During the journey my companions
were almost completely silent. Lady Hartmore
kept her veil down, and, I felt sure,
wished to avoid speaking to me. The old
lord was completely prostrated with grief.
Not by word or hint had either parent given
me the slightest clue by which I could insist
on a post-mortem examination. Their son
had evidently enjoyed perfect health during
his brief life. I saw that circumstances were
very black against Carleton.</p>

<p>It was evening when we reached Penporran.
Lord and Lady Hartmore went at
once to a private suite of rooms which had
been got ready for their reception. As
soon as I could I sought an interview with
Brabazon.</p>

<p>"Most of our visitors have left us," he said.
"But Miss Farnham and, of course, Carleton,
remain. The inquest is to take place in the
library at an early hour to-morrow."</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment, then I said,
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Even at the risk of annoying you, Brabazon,
I must repeat my strong desire that
a post-mortem should precede the coroner's
inquest."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to the Hartmores on
the subject?" inquired Brabazon.</p>

<p>I told him that I had mentioned my wish
to Lady Hartmore.</p>

<p>"And what did she say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She shrank from the idea with horror," I
was obliged to confess.</p>

<p>"You can scarcely blame her," said
Brabazon. "Why should the poor fellow's
body be unnecessarily disturbed? The fact
is, I have the greatest faith in your judgment,
Halifax, but I think in the present instance
you carry your sympathy for Ronald Carleton
too far. The cause of death in the
case of poor Randall was so absolutely
apparent, that I do not think you will get the
coroner to consent to a post-mortem."</p>

<p>"There is one thing that occurred to me,"
I said: "if Randall met his death by violence,
there would be some traces of a struggle at
the spot where he fell over. Randall would
not tamely submit to murder&mdash;he was a big
man and muscular. Has the path along the
cliff been carefully searched?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Brabazon, "and there is no
trace anywhere of a struggle. A little blood
has been discovered on a sharp point of rock
just where Carleton described the fall to
have taken place. The marks of a heavy
body being dragged along the sands above
high-water mark have also been seen. All
these evidences are, of course, I am bound to
say, quite consistent with Carleton's story.
The blood on the rock indicates also the
exact spot of the accident."</p>

<p>"That was where the vault of the skull
was broken," I said. "By the way, you
forgot to give me poor Randall's letter to
his mother. Doubtless Lady Hartmore would
like to have it without a moment's delay."</p>

<p>Brabazon started, and put his hand in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I put the letter here," he said, "intending
to give it to you as you were starting;
of course, I forgot it. Here it is; no, though,
there is nothing in my pocket. Surely I
can't have dropped it anywhere. I know I
put it here this morning. I rushed up to
the poor fellow's room to fetch it just when
the brougham was coming round."</p>

<p>"You did not give it to me," I said;
"that letter ought to be found: it may be
of the utmost importance. Was that the
coat you wore this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have not been out of it all day;
you don't know what a rush and confusion
the whole place has been in."</p>

<p>"You will look for the letter, won't you,
Brabazon? I cannot quite tell you why, but
it will give me a sense of relief to know that
it has been found before the inquest takes
place to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we parted. I went into
one of the morning-rooms, where I found
Mrs. Brabazon. I made inquiries with regard
to Carleton and Miss Farnham.</p>

<p>"I have not seen either of them," replied
my hostess. "I believe Mr. Carleton has
spent the day in his room, and a servant told
me that Barbara Farnham was not well. I
hear she has not risen at all to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor girl!" I ejaculated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brabazon looked at me with languid
interest&mdash;she was a very lethargic person.</p>

<p>"Yes," she ejaculated, after a pause&mdash;"this
tragedy will be a sad blow to Barbara. She
is as ambitious as she is handsome. She
would have made a regal-looking Lady
Hartmore."</p>

<p>I said nothing further&mdash;I could not betray
the poor girl's secret, nor let Mrs. Brabazon
know what a small place high position and
greatness occupied just now in Miss
Farnham's thoughts.</p>

<p>Just before the inquest the next morning,
I asked Brabazon if the missing letter had
been found.</p>

<p>"No," he said&mdash;"I cannot tell you how
vexed I am about it. Every conceivable
hole and corner both in the house and out
has been searched, but no trace of the letter
has been discovered. What I fear is that
when I was down on the shore yesterday
making investigations, it may have dropped
out of my pocket and been washed away with
the incoming tide. I cannot think of any
other cause for its absolute disappearance. I
beg of you, Halifax, not to say anything to
Lady Hartmore about it for the present."</p>

<p>"Of course not," I answered, in some
surprise at the request.</p>

<p>I then ran upstairs. I must, of course, be
present at the inquest, but I had still a
moment at my disposal. I went boldly to
Miss Farnham's door and knocked. After
a very brief pause she opened it herself and
stood before me. She was fully dressed.
Her face was of a dead white&mdash;all the
beautiful warmth of colour had fled.</p>

<p>"I am told I must be present at the
inquest," she said. "Is it time for me to go
downstairs? Have you come to fetch me?"
She shuddered visibly as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I have come to ask you to help me," I
said, eagerly. "I will manage to account
for your absence in the library. Put on
your hat; I want you to go out at once."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," I said. "On the day
of his death Randall wrote a letter to
his mother. That letter has been lost.
Brabazon had it in his pocket and has
dropped it&mdash;no one knows where. There is
no saying, Miss Farnham, what important
evidence that letter may contain. I am sure
it is not in the house. Brabazon believes
that he dropped it when exploring the coast
yesterday. Will you go at once and look for
it? The moment you discover it, bring it
to the library. Now, be as quick as ever you
can."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, the soul in her eyes leaping
up with a sudden renewed joy. She turned,
pinned a hat on her head, wrapped a shawl
round her, and ran downstairs. Her woman's
wit grasped the whole situation at a glance.
I went to the library, feeling assured that if
poor Randall's letter were still in existence,
Miss Farnham would find it.</p>

<p>There were present at the inquest Lady
Hartmore, Brabazon and his wife, Carleton,
and two gentlemen who had not yet left the
house. Also, of course, the coroner and
the jury. The moment I entered the
room I glanced at the coroner; I had
not seen him before. He was a little
old gentleman, with a somewhat irascible
expression of face, and a testy manner. I
looked from him to poor Carleton, whom I
had not seen since the time when he told
his story in this room. The body of the
dead man had been placed in a shell, and
still occupied the central table of the library.
Lady Hartmore sat near it. A sheet covered
the face of the dead. Once I saw her raise
her hand and touch the sheet reverently.
She had the attitude of one who was protecting
the body from intended violence.
Her position and the look on her face
reminded me of Rispah.</p>

<p>I looked again from her to Carleton. It
was necessary for me to glance at the poor
fellow, and to notice the despair on his face,
to enable me to go up to the coroner, and
urge upon him the necessity of a post-mortem
preceding the inquest. He did not
take my suggestion kindly.</p>

<p>"The cause of death is abundantly
evident," he said, with irritation. "I cannot
counsel a post-mortem examination."</p>

<p>"And I will not hear of it," said Lady
Hartmore, looking at me with eyes full of
reproach.</p>

<p>"Pray say nothing more about it," exclaimed
Carleton.</p>

<p>I bowed, and sat down.</p>

<p>The inquest was conducted with extreme
care, but soon Miss Farnham's presence was
found necessary, and her absence commented
upon. I saw Carleton start when her name
was mentioned, and a look of extreme distress
filled his eyes.</p>

<p>"I will go and find her," said Mrs. Brabazon,
leaving the room.</p>

<p>She returned in a moment to say that
Miss Farnham was not in her room, and
that no one seemed to know anything
about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have sent several servants into the
grounds to look for her," she said.</p>

<p>As Miss Farnham was an important witness,
having spent almost the entire day previous
to his death with poor Randall, proceedings
were delayed during her absence.</p>

<p>The case, however, seemed as black
as could be against Carleton, and I had
not the least doubt that the coroner would
order a warrant to be issued for his arrest on
suspicion.</p>

<p>My one last hope now hung on Miss
Farnham's being able to find the missing
letter, and then on the letter
containing evidence which
would give a medical cause
for poor Randall's extraordinary
death.</p>

<p>I seldom found myself in a
more torturing position than
during the time of this inquest.
Relief, however, was at hand.
I heard the sound of light and
quickly moving feet in the
hall. The door of the library
was opened, not softly and with
reverent hush,
but with the
eager, impetuous
movement
of someone in
hot haste. Miss
Farnham came
into the room
with a wild
colour in her
cheeks and a
wild, bright light
in her eyes. Her
skirts were draggled
and wet,
her hair was
loosened and
fell over her
shoulders&mdash;she
had cast away
both hat and
shawl.</p>

said, going
straight up to Lady Hartmore; "there's your
letter&mdash;the last letter your son ever wrote to
you. It was lost, or supposed to be lost, but I
found it. I walked along the cliff, close to the
edge&mdash;very close. There is a part where the
cliff is undermined. I lay on my face and
hands and looked over. I saw, far below
me, a tiny ledge of rock: there was a bush
growing there, and, sticking in the bush,
something white&mdash;it might be a useless rag
or a piece of torn paper, or it might be a
letter of importance. The tide was coming
in fast; still, I thought that I had time. I
put wings to my feet and rushed down a
narrow path which led to the beach below.
The tide had already come up and was
wetting the base of the rock above which
the bush which contained the white paper
stood.</p>

<p>"I waded through the water and climbed
the cliff and got the paper. I scrambled
down again. When I came back the water
was up to my knees. I
crossed it safely, and
mounted to the higher cliff
again. Then, for the first
time, I examined my prize.
Yes, it was a letter&mdash;it was
open. I don't know what
had become of its covering.
I sat on the grass
and I read it&mdash;yes, I read
every word. Here it is
now, and you can read it.
Read it aloud,
please, for it is
important&mdash;it
explains, it
saves! Ronald,
it saves you!"
Here the excited
girl paused
in her eager narrative,
and
turned her full
gaze upon Carleton,
who was
bending forward
to listen to her.
"It saves you,"
she repeated;
"it exonerates
you completely!"</p>

<p>The commotion
and interest
which Miss
Farnham's
words and manner
excited can be better felt than described.
Lady Hartmore stood up and confronted the
breathless girl. She held out her hand and
clutched the letter, which was torn and dirty
from its long exposure to wind and weather.
She held it close and looked at it. It was in
the beloved writing of the dead. The dead
man was her only son&mdash;the letter was
addressed to her, his mother. It contained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
last message from the brain now silent&mdash;from
the heart now still.</p>

<p>Tears filled her eyes.</p>

<p>"I must read this letter in private," she
faltered. "This last letter of my boy's is too
sacred for anyone but his mother to hear&mdash;I
must read it alone."</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Miss Farnham, "it contains
important information. I will call upon
the coroner to insist on its being read aloud.
I risked my life to get it. Another life hangs
upon the information it contains. Dr.
Halifax, you are a medical man&mdash;will you
insist on this letter being read aloud?"</p>

<p>I went up to Lady Hartmore and said
something to her in a low voice. She listened
attentively&mdash;she considered my words. After
a pause she put the letter into my hands.</p>

<p>"If it must be, it must," she said. "This
is the last drop in the bitterness of my cup."</p>

<p>She sat down, and flinging out her two
arms, stretched them over the body of the
dead man. Once more her attitude and
manner reminded me of Rispah.</p>

<p>Miss Farnham stood close to Lady Hartmore.
She forgot her dishevelled hair, her
disordered appearance. All her soul filled
the eyes which she raised expectantly to
my face.</p>

<p>I glanced hurriedly through the letter,
then I spoke.</p>

<p>"There is a good deal in this sheet of
paper which is strictly private," I said, "and
need not be read for the benefit of the coroner
and the jury; but there are some sentences
referring to the state of Mr. Randall's health
which are, as Miss Farnham remarked, of
the utmost importance. I will now proceed
to read that portion of the letter."</p>

<p>I did so in a loud, clear voice.</p>

<p>These were poor Randall's words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As far as I can tell, I am in perfect
health, but for the last week or so, I have
been suffering at intervals from a strange
form of giddiness. I feel as though I were
made to turn round and round, or against my
will impelled to go forwards, or backwards,
or to one side. Sometimes the giddiness
takes another form&mdash;I fancy that objects are
revolving round <i>me</i>. I am perfectly conscious
all the time, but the giddiness is generally
accompanied by a distinct sensation of
nausea. Very often the act of closing my
eyes removes the vertigo completely for the
time being. When the attack goes off I feel
perfectly well, only I fancy I am suffering
from continued deafness in my right ear.
I don't know why I am impelled to tell you
this&mdash;it is not worth making a fuss over. If
I were to consult a medical man, he would
probably set it down to a form of indigestion.
I had a slight attack this morning at
breakfast. If it continues or gets worse, I
will take the opportunity of consulting a
London doctor who happens to be in the
house."</p>

<p>I did not read any more, but folding up
the letter returned it to Lady Hartmore.
Both Carleton and Miss Farnham had
approached each other in their excitement.</p>

<p>I looked beyond them to the coroner.</p>

<p>"I am sure," I said, "that I now express
Lady Hartmore's sentiments as well as my
own, when I demand that this inquest be
adjourned until a post-mortem examination
has been made on the body of the dead
man. The symptoms which he describes in
the letter which I have just read aloud distinctly
point to a disease of the inner ear,
well known to the medical faculty, although
not of common occurrence. I will ask the
coroner to take immediate steps to get the
services of two independent doctors to
conduct the post-mortem, at which I should
wish to be present."</p>

<p>My words were followed by a slight pause&mdash;the
coroner then agreed to my wishes, and
the inquest was adjourned.</p>

<p>The post-mortem took place on the afternoon
of that same day, and the results amply
accounted for the strange symptoms which
poor Randall had so faithfully described in
his last letter to his mother. On the right
side of that portion of the base of the skull
which contains the delicate organs of hearing,
we found a small, bony excrescence growing
down into the labyrinth or inner ear. This,
though small, was undoubtedly the cause of
the terrible attacks of vertigo which the
poor fellow complained of, and in one of
which he met with his tragic death.</p>

<p>The coroner's inquest was resumed on the
following day, and, of course, Carleton was
abundantly exonerated.</p>

<p>It was two years afterwards, however,
before I accidentally saw in the <i>Times</i> the
announcement of his marriage with Miss
Farnham.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> up-to-date counterfeit-money
coiner is one of the
most difficult individuals with
whom the police have to deal.
He is a positive artist. He no
longer cuts shillings with a pair
of scissors out of brass and silvers them over,
as was done in the early part of the present
century. He employs more scientific means,
and his methods are such that only men of
considerable ingenuity and inventive powers
could possibly hope to bring them to
a successful issue. But, alas! as in most
things&mdash;woman's in it!&mdash;and to the fair sex
belongs the first case on record in which any
person appears to have been executed for
counterfeiting the coin of the realm.</p>

<p>In May, 1721, Barbara Spencer had the
crime brought home to her of indulging in
the&mdash;in those days&mdash;highly treasonable pastime
of manufacturing shilling pieces. She
employed two other women, Alice Hall and
Elizabeth Bray, to act as her agents, or
"passers," and it is a significant fact that
in almost every case of counterfeiting up
to the present day women are employed in
this particular branch of the profession.
Barbara, it should be mentioned, was
strangled and burned at Tyburn, on the 5th
July, 1721, her accomplices being acquitted.</p>

<p>The question may be asked: Is the manufacture
of counterfeit coin in a flourishing
condition? The answer is a very decided
affirmative. True, the convictions against
counterfeiters are few and far between; but
that is owing to the very elaborate measures
adopted by the counterfeiters themselves of
preventing a knowledge of their whereabouts
becoming the property of the police. Your
next-door neighbour may be a magnificent
hand at turning out "five-bob" pieces; your
butcher, greengrocer, and milk purveyor may
all be adepts at the game. In proof of this,
examine this bell and its companion. One
is an ordinary electric bell&mdash;the other an
invalid's bell-push.</p>

<p>Thomas Raven, <i>alias</i> Cooper, Beauchamp,
and "Tom the Tailor," was a tailor in
the salubrious neighbourhood of Bethnal
Green. The police made a raid upon the
premises and discovered something like 200
pieces of base coin in the cellar below,
and between the joists some lampblack,
plaster of Paris, and a spoon which had contained
molten metal. The coiners were fairly
caught. It was the duty of the gentleman
in charge of the shop upstairs to give a certain
signal with the bell, to warn the enterprising
personages downstairs. A mistake was made,
and the irrepressible Tom remarked, when
told the charge: "Well, I have had a long
run; but if they had given the signals right
this morning, you would not have had me
now."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a long run. It took three
years to run "Tom the Tailor" and a lady who
helped to get rid of the coin to earth; and it
was believed that the <i>pseudo</i> coat-cutter had
been making counterfeit coin for the last
seventeen years, and before that he had acted
as coiners' agent. If time is money, Tom
is still at his old occupation&mdash;fourteen years'
penal servitude.</p>

<p>New Scotland Yard has every reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
be proud of its counterfeit
collection&mdash;it certainly has
real and original samples
of everything associated
with this glittering profession,
which we shall now
proceed to specify. We do
so without the slightest
qualms of conscience, and
without any fear that anything
we may say may lead
to anybody admiring these
remarks too greatly, and
seeking to imitate. We are
informed that years of
practice are necessary to
come up to the standard
counterfeit coin of to-day.
Take this sovereign, which
is accorded the place of
honour in one of the glass
cases. It was made in
Barcelona, and actually contains
sixteen shillings' worth
of gold in its composition.
It would deceive a banker&mdash;there
is the true, honest,
unadulterated ring about it.
Its date is 1862. To those
whom it may concern&mdash;that is, those
who happen to be in possession of
sovereigns of this date&mdash;this fact may
be interesting. Beware of Barcelonas!</p>

<div class="caption"><p>COINERS SURPRISED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But this gold piece is an exception.
There are two or three thousand gold
and silver coins here&mdash;all arranged in
the prettiest and most delightful of
heaps&mdash;that would not deceive the
easiest-going of individuals. Pennies,
sixpences, shillings, two-shilling pieces,
half-crowns, crown pieces, half-sovereigns,
and sovereigns are all
here, the most popular, however,
amongst the fraternity being the
shilling, two-shilling piece, and half-crown,
as people, when they accept
change, are less likely to "try" these
than coins of a higher value. There
are some coins here, however, which
positively call for respect. These
George IV. half-crowns are perfect.
The King's head is partially worn
away by time&mdash;grit and dirt, from
constant use of seventy years, are
lodged in the creases of the coin.
But time did not wear the King's
features away, or constant use provide
the dirt. After the
coin was in a finished
state it was placed on
a burnishing board
(Fig. 1) made of a
piece of ordinary deal,
with a few tacks stuck
in to hold the coins in
position&mdash;and rubbed
over with an old scrubbing
brush, in order
to dull the coin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
give it an ancient appearance. And the dirt?
It is here quite handy. It is in a match-box
bearing a portrait of General Gordon, whilst
another deposit is in a small tin whose label
tells that it was originally intended for
mustard. Both the match-box and the
mustard-tin contain lampblack. The bellows
is used for "blowing-up" purposes (Fig. 2).</p>

</div>

<p>But George IV. is, or was, a great
favourite with counterfeiters. There are such
things in this world as lucky sixpences, and
they are signalled out as such charms, should
they happen to have a hole bored through
them. Who
would not give
a mere paltry
ordinary sixpence
for one
of these bringers
of luck, and
a George IV.
at that? Echo
answers&mdash;everybody.
We
hope Echo will
be more careful
after learning
the use of this
little drill which
we are now
examining (Fig.
3). It is used
by counterfeiters
to bore
holes into sixpences,
which
they can warrant,
seeing that
they are their own
make. The
counterfeit
brooch is not
missing from the
collection. It had
its birth with the
issue of the Jubilee
coins, when
those who could
afford it had one
of the gold Jubilee
five-pound
pieces&mdash;which
were coined to
the value of over
&pound;250,000&mdash;mounted
as a
brooch, and worn
or treasured as a
souvenir of the
fiftieth anniversary of Her Majesty's accession
to the throne. Once again the counterfeiter
had a chance. True, the Jubilee
sixpences offered him admirable opportunities
in the way of giving further
point to the old adage that "All is not
gold that glitters." But he went farther. He
made counterfeit half-crowns and five-shilling
pieces, fastened pins to them, and put them
on the market, charging but a small sum for
the supplementary fastener.</p>

<p>"Well," argued the purchaser, "the coin
will always be worth the money!" Permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
us to observe that the price realized for sham
coins rarely exceeds twopence to twopence-halfpenny
in the shilling, whilst a true, sterling
shilling would buy four base half-crowns.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 4.&mdash;MOULD FOR FIVE-SHILLING PIECE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In order to arrive in some measure at the
exact method of manufacture, it is proposed
to examine the curiosities of the New Scotland
Yard counterfeiting cases more minutely.</p>

<p>Every coiner has his "pattern" piece, that
is, a genuine piece of money, which is to
give the cast of the coin intended to
be copied. The cast from the true coin
is taken in plaster of Paris of the finest
possible quality. There are enough moulds
here to thoroughly colonize a country with
counterfeiters! They may be accepted as
excellent examples, for the greater proportion
formed part of the stock-in-trade of the
notorious John H&mdash;&mdash;, <i>alias</i> Sydney A&mdash;&mdash;,
who was rewarded with twenty years; some
were also found on the premises occupied
by a famous Fulham coiner&mdash;whose name
we are asked not to publish, but of whom
more anon; others belonged to a worthy who
made the fine and large crown-pieces a speciality
(Fig. 4). Some are quite clean, others
are burnt through constant use, not a few
show the coin in its rough state, with the
edge uncut and unfiled (Fig. 5), a process
performed by an ordinary pocket-knife and
file; whilst a "half-crown" mould reveals the
"get" (Fig. 6), or surplus liquid, which is
poured into this receptacle for making false
impressions.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 619px;">
<img src="images/i_419b.jpg" width="619" height="202" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 5.&mdash;COUNTERFEIT COINS (UNFINISHED).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here are the lead and ladles (Fig. 7). The
ladles belonged to a man who was forced to
submit to twelve years' penal servitude as
recently as 1891. They are about one and
a half feet long, and are used for melting the
composition on the fire. The ladles are similar
to those used by plumbers, costing perhaps
eighteen-pence or a couple of shillings. When
a ladle is not used, then a melting-pot or
crucible is called into requisition (Fig. 8);
even a saucepan would not be despised.
When a pot or a saucepan is used the glittering
liquid is taken out in a boiling state by
iron spoons&mdash;and these spoons, of all shapes
and sizes, designs and prices, are provided
with a special corner.</p>

<p>Much speculation has always existed as to
the real ingredients of a counterfeit coin.
Solder here is another item in the plumber's
outfit&mdash;is often the original foundation. But
such lead is very poor in itself, and tin and
bismuth have both been found to possess
excellent hardening properties (Fig. 9). But
the finest foundation for a counterfeit coin is
obtained out of a
certain receptacle
from which your
average working
man invariably
blows the froth previous
to sampling
the contents&mdash;pewter-pots!
Here we
have a reason for
the frequent thefts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
of the traditional holders of mild and bitter,
and when such a theft is brought home to a
man, he is at once surmised, and very
properly so, to be in league with coiners.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 643px;">

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 6.&mdash;A HALF-CROWN MOULD, SHOWING "GET".</p></div>
</div>

<p>Whilst on the subject of pewter-pots, the
writer is inclined to relate an amusing
incident, communicated to him by an East-end
publican. Some curious contests take
place in Whitechapel and its environs, one of
the most popular of which is that of pewter-pot
cleaning, when James, the potman at the
"Three Boot Brushes," meets William, who
holds a similar position at the "Laughing
Lobster," in friendly rivalry, to decide who can
clean the greatest number of pewter-pots in
an hour.</p>

<p>This particular East-end publican had such
a contest at his "house" one Sunday morning,
and after a most exciting contest his own
particular potman won. This was all very
comforting. But, by some mysterious means,
the same evening the public-house was
robbed of a number
of pots&mdash;and all
clean, too!</p>

<p>"I wouldn't 'ave
minded <i>that</i>, sir,"
said the communicative
publican,
with a decided
emphasis on the
"that," when relating
this&mdash;"I wouldn't
'ave minded
<i>that</i>: but what
annoyed me was
the remarkable
number of bad two-shilling
pieces me and the missus took over
the counter a week afterwards!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 608px;">
<img src="images/i_420b.jpg" width="608" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 7.&mdash;LEAD AND LADLES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The pewter having been melted, the coins
having been cast&mdash;the two sides of the mould
being kept together by clamps made of strong
hoop-iron, in order to secure a firm impression
(Fig. 10)&mdash;filed and edged, and got as near the
proper weight of a good coin as possible, a
very important process now takes place. We
will take "silver" coins as an example. The
coins are put on battery racks. Several of
these are to be found here&mdash;a pair (Fig. 11)
near a couple of batteries (Fig. 12) will suit our
purpose well. One is empty, and shows the
wires made in various sizes to hold securely
the coin intended to be immersed in the bath
containing the silvering solution. The other,
as will be seen in the illustration, is well
charged with coins. The process of silvering
coins is exactly similar to that of plating
knives, spoons, forks, etc., though the vat&mdash;which
is usually made of iron with a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
lining of wood&mdash;containing
the
plating liquid is
very much
smaller than
those used by
men engaged in
a legitimate
business.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i_421a.jpg" width="611" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 8.&mdash;MELTING-POT AND CRUCIBLES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The "charged"
rack is now put
into the vat.
Coins made out
of Britannia
metal, tin, or
pewter are not
dropped into
acid before plating,
but into a
very strong and boiling hot solution of
pure caustic potash. The coins are then
scratched with a small brush especially
made for this purpose, or at once taken
from the alkali without having been immersed
in water, and plunged direct into a cyanide
of silver solution at about 190&deg; Fahrenheit.
An electric current of great strength is run
through the vat in which are the coins until
they begin to receive a thin coating. After
this they undergo a treatment of ordinary
plating solution to receive the full amount
of silvering required. This completed, they
are fixed on a burnishing board to relieve
them of any undue brightness.</p>

<p>We have already referred to a board of
this kind, but there is one at New Scotland
Yard of peculiar interest. In the first place,
it is curious from the fact that it is made out
of the seat of a common wooden kitchen
chair (Fig. 13), and, further, it is surrounded
by far more curiosity when it is known that it
once formed part of the stock-in-trade of one
of the most scientific coiners of modern times.
His name can only be hinted at as "the
Party from Fulham." He approached coining
from a thoroughly artistic point of view.
His ideas of counterfeiting and gilding were
all carried out on the highest scientific
principles, and an examination of his
property revealed an extraordinary state of
affairs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 609px;">
<img src="images/i_421b.jpg" width="609" height="251" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 9.&mdash;TIN AND BISMUTH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When arrested he had in his possession
8s. 10-1/2d. in good money, together with a
shilling and two sixpences, which, judging
from their appearance, had evidently been
used as "pattern" pieces. But his home-made
coins were as extensive as they were
peculiar. They included 1 five-pound piece,
8 two-pound pieces, 31 sovereigns, 18 half-sovereigns,
125 half-crowns, 51 florins, 101
shillings, and 171 sixpences. A capital and
convincing collection! In addition, he had
in the way of manufacturing paraphernalia,
17 moulds, 1 battery, 2 ladles, a quantity of
plaster of Paris, melting-pot, plate of sand,
9 bottles of chemicals&mdash;including gold plating
solution and liquid ammonia, a selection of
which receptacles is shown in company with
a Leclanch&eacute; battery (Fig. 14), made out of
a common three-pound jam jar&mdash;files, clamps,
brushes, etc.; in short, everything to prove
that he was the
one to whom the
expression of
"You're coining
money, old boy!"
would be honestly
applied by any
enterprising detective
anxious to
slap him on the
back and to decorate
him with "the
bracelets."</p>

<p>Perhaps, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>ever,
the books he used are the most
interesting. These consist of a couple of
standard works on chemistry, which he
had freely interpolated with marginal notes
and pencil marks against anything calculated
to assist him in the pursuit of his
profession. But his "private" reference
book is the good thing in his pack of literature.
It is a book similar to that which
any schoolboy would use to do his homework
in. It contains the addresses of
English taverns in Paris, servants' registry
offices, sewing machine dealers, shops
where furniture may be obtained on hire,
house agents, money-lenders, addresses of
statesmen, etc. The newspaper cuttings in
this volume are of a varied character, and
include an advertisement of "A Young
Gentleman who has a Grand Piano for Sale,"
"A Good Cure for a Cold," "Cure for Chilblains,"
"Furniture Polish," and prescriptions
for removing surplus hair from the
back of the neck, the right treatment of
headaches, the proper ingredients for making
a highly satisfactory mustard plaster, and a
certain cure for sluggish livers!</p>

</div>

<p>"The Party from Fulham" adopted&mdash;probably
in his early career&mdash;an ingenious
means of becoming possessed of useful
information&mdash;a method which it would be
well if those papers who reply indiscriminately
to questions sent them would make note
of. He would write to periodicals asking
such simple conundrums as, "Will you
kindly tell me the simplest way to make a
battery?" or, "Would you kindly say in an
early issue the simplest way to make solder
for silver?" He often got replies, as is
proved from a newspaper cutting, giving
an answer to the last query&mdash;an answer we
refrain from publishing, seeing that it gives
a very efficacious recipe for the first step
towards "making money."</p>

<p>Further, it is presumed
that "the
Party from Fulham"
either kept
a shop, was a receiver
of stolen
property, or else
attended sales and
purchased articles
in the hopes of
pawning them and
securing a profit&mdash;the
latter a distinct
business in
the East-end of
London. The
book contains an entry against the name
of a well-known pawnbroker, of "a wedding-ring,
4s.," followed by the bitterly suggestive
words, "ticket lost"! And there are
entries relating to everything between a violin
and a paillasse, a brass fender and a blue
beaver coat. There is actually a ticket of
admission to a cookery lecture, which all goes
to prove that "the Party from Fulham" was
a most prolific personage.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 11.&mdash;BATTERY RACKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We propose saying something as to how
counterfeit coins are circulated, with one or
two instances of ingenuity on the part of
those responsible for putting them about.
The coins being completely finished, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
are wrapped up in tissue paper (Fig. 15)
in parcels of a dozen or so, with a piece
of paper between each coin in order to keep
them from scratching and chinking when
passed from one person's hand to another's.
There are usually four persons employed
in a delivery of counterfeit coin to the
public: the maker, the agent, or go-between&mdash;in
most cases a woman&mdash;the buyer, and
the passer proper, the latter individual never
knowing who the actual maker is. The
bundles of coins are generally sold at street
corners by appointment only or in public
houses. They are conveyed to the rendezvous
in many ways, perhaps the most original of
which was that of the man who carried a
couple of bird-cages&mdash;one containing a beautiful
little singer which trilled
away to its heart's content, and
the other full of counterfeit
money!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i_423a.jpg" width="341" height="215" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 12.&mdash;ELECTRIC BATTERIES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Women, more often than not,
lead to a conviction, as the
would-be passer, say of a bad
half-crown on a too-confiding
grocer, has seldom more than
one bad coin on him. He
makes a small purchase at the
grocer's and tenders the coin.
The man of sugar and spice
looks at it.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he remarks,
"but I think this half-crown
is bad!"</p>

<p>Artful one takes it back.</p>

<p>"Dear me, so it is! Ah!
that's all right," giving a good
one this time. "Thanks. No,
don't trouble to
send it home.
Good day!"</p>

<p>Had he succeeded
in passing
the half crown, ten
minutes afterwards
he would have
been supplied with
one equally bad by
the lady in waiting
round the corner.
This is where the
police find such
difficulty in bringing
home a conviction
to the
actual passer, as
anybody in these
deceitful days
might find himself
the unfortunate possessor of a spurious coin.
Perhaps the before-mentioned grocer would
complain to a policeman. The man would
be watched. He would be seen to "speak
to the woman." That would be quite enough&mdash;and
the possibilities are that they would
find the counterfeit coins concealed about
her person, as was the case with a lady
whose Christian name was Harriet, and who
owned to thirty-nine years of age at Clerkenwell
Police-court, who had no fewer than
forty counterfeit florins sewn up in her dress.
It was sufficient to cast her husband on the
hospitality of a country, the inhabitants of
which are not inclined to grumble at being
obliged to provide him with convict comforts
for a period of eight years.</p>

</div>

<p>A frequent method employed is to "work"
a publican&mdash;and this is the more enterprising
on the "passer's" part, seeing that the
generality of publicans are men who are not
often to be caught asleep.</p>

<p>Scene: "The Last House."</p>

<p>Enter well-dressed man smoking big cigar.</p>

<p>Polite Publican: "Good evening, sir."</p>

<p>Big Cigar Proprietor: "Good evening.
Brandy and soda, please!" (Throws down a
sovereign, receives brandy and soda and
change, the change all in silver. Big Cigar
Proprietor picks up change.)</p>

<p>Big Cigar Proprietor: "Oh! excuse me&mdash;could
you let me have half-a-sovereign for ten
shillings' worth of this silver?"</p>

<p>Polite Publican (always ready to oblige):
"Certainly, sir." (Does so.)</p>

<p>The publican gets, as he thinks, ten
shillings' worth of silver back. Does he?
Oh, dear, no! There were three bad
two-shilling pieces
amongst it!</p>

<p>It would be
difficult to hit
upon two more
contrasting illustrations
than the
following. The
first instance
goes to prove that
children are
called into play
as "passers"&mdash;though
unconsciously
so&mdash;in
the case when
the smallest
"coined" piece
is to be thrust on
the public.</p>

<p>A man used his
little girl to go
into small confectioners'
shops
and purchase a
farthing's worth
of sweetmeats.
The little one
tendered a bad
penny, obtaining
her sweets and
giving her father
the three farthings
change. Both
were arrested and
charged. The
child, however,
was taken out of
the dock and put in the box to give evidence
against her father. Her childish evidence
was convincing enough, and at the end of
the examination, the man, overcome with
better feelings, contrived to catch the little
one up in his arms, ere he was sent down
below, caressing her fondly and covering her
tiny face with kisses.</p>

<p>Such a method&mdash;an awkward method, and
one in every way calculated to be eventually
found out&mdash;stands in strong contrast with
the really delicate and ingenious means employed
by a lady whose efforts at changing
a sovereign were worthy a better cause.</p>

<p>Her <i>modus operandi</i> was to select say a
boot-maker's shop, generally in a well-populated
suburban district, and purchase boots
to the value of nineteen and sixpence.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly send them to my house,
No. 42, Easyway Terrace, in an hour's time?"
she asks the shopkeeper.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CARRYING COUNTERFEIT COIN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Certainly, madam."</p>

<p>"I will pay the messenger when he
brings them&mdash;I find I have not sufficient
money in my purse. Mrs. Adams is my
name," she further remarks, and leaves the
shop.</p>

<p>In an hour's time the boy with the boots
is on his way to No. 42, Easyway Terrace.
Curiously enough, he is met outside by Mrs.
Adams herself!</p>

<p>"Oh! are those boots for Mrs. Adams?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mum."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Let me see," playing with
her purse, "nineteen and six. There's a
sovereign. You can keep the sixpence for
being so punctual."</p>

<p>The lad is delighted, and away he goes
whistling. The lady is equally pleased&mdash;away
she goes with the boots to a pawnbroker's.
The shopkeeper is in a rage&mdash;for
the sovereign is a counterfeit one!</p>

<p>It will be well to state the best means of
detecting counterfeit coin. The simplest and
most effective test is to bite it. If the coin
is bad, the bite will produce a very gritty
sensation on the teeth, which is never produced
by a genuine piece of money. This
test will be found to be an infallible one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Meyer Lutz.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_428.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Herr Meyer Lutz</span> has the
rather odd fancy of sitting in
the dark for an hour or two
at a time, and letting his
fingers wander hither and
thither over the keys, searching
out those measures which set the fashion
in the dancing world.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 635px;">
<img src="images/i_428b_m.jpg" width="635" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>truly yours</p>

<p>Herr Meyer Lutz</p></div>
</div>

<p>He composes anywhere and everywhere,
in the streets, on tops of 'buses, and even
in church.</p>

<p>"I remember," says the popular Gaiety
composer, "driving one Sunday evening to
St. George's Cathedral, when the melody to
an 'O Salutaris' struck me. I pencilled it
down during the sermon, and my brother-in-law,
Furneaux Cook, sang it after the sermon
at Benediction the same evening."</p>

<p>Herr Lutz believes in taking up some verses
and carefully studying them.</p>

<p>"This I often do," he says, "and soon
seem to hear a fitting melody without trying
it on the piano till finished."</p>

<p>Fugues and canons, in his opinion, want
studying and mathematically experimentalizing.
"Composers," he says in conclusion,
"are musical poets, and 'Po&euml;ta nascitur, non
fit.'"</p>

<p>The music in his autograph will, I imagine,
be familiar to not a few of my readers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A. C. Mackenzie.</span></h3>

<p>Most of Dr. Mackenzie's work is done in
the morning from nine to one-thirty, and he
never touches it in the afternoon. As a
rule he leaves <i>scoring</i> for the orchestra or
looking over the morning's work for the
evening hours. "But," in his own words,
"if I feel capable of <i>inventing</i>, why, I begin
to work again about eight-thirty and continue
until I am tired."</p>

<p>As a rule, the principal of the Royal
Academy of Music sketches his music on
two or three lines, as shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>"When I am engaged upon anything that
absorbs my entire attention," he continues,
"I carry a little musical note-book about
with me and jot down roughly any idea
which may occur to me, and I have found
this plan useful. When I am composing I
never lose the thread of it, morning, noon, or
night; even at meals I am unconsciously
occupied with it&mdash;this goes on until the work
is finished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>We have waited for long ... waited for long!</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie decidedly disapproves of
the manner in which composers in England
are made to work&mdash;viz., to order.</p>

<p>"Such pressure," he says, emphatically, "is
unproductive of the best work, and highly
detrimental to one's general health and
comfort."</p>

<p>For those reasons he objects to undertake
commissions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tito Mattei.</span></h3>

<p>Signor Tito Mattei composes most of his
instrumental music at the piano, but songs
are composed anywhere, wherever and whenever
he feels so inspired.</p>

<p>One thing he considers absolutely indispensable
to the success of a composer, viz., a
thoroughly good musical education, without
which no one, however gifted, can hope to
make a name.</p>

<p>"As a whole," writes this composer, "the
English people love music, but are not,
strictly speaking, a musical nation, the reason
being that they do not give sufficient time
and care to the study."</p>

<p>The accompanying few bars of music are
taken from his popular song "Beside Me."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hubert Parry.</span></h3>

<p>Professor C. Hubert Parry, whose last
work, "Job," has been so enthusiastically
received and criticised by the musical world,
composes according to the nature of the
composition on which he is engaged.</p>

<p>"There are a hundred and fifty different
kinds of work to be done in composing," he
says, "and they vary in accordance with its
being a big work like a symphony or an
oratorio, or an opera, or a little thing like a
song or a pianoforte piece. Then, what one
wants may come into one's head when walking
or driving, or in bed&mdash;anywhere, indeed,
but in front of the paper it has to be written
on. Then there is the general scheme to be
considered, which usually comes first, and
has to be thought out in big, cloudy way,
out of which the details emerge into distinctness
by degrees, and often want doing over
and over again."</p>

<p>Like many another composer, Mr. Parry
prefers the morning for the mechanical part
of the art, viz., the work of scoring and writing
down and getting into order those ideas
which have already been conceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>"As far as new ideas and schemes are concerned,"
he adds, "I am glad enough to take
them at any time of the day they are so
obliging as to come."</p>

<p>It is wonderful how chary the English composers
are of answering the question as to
whether or no they consider their countrymen
a musical race. It seems a subject on which
they fear to express an opinion, and either treat
the matter with silence or, like Sir Joseph
Barnby, content themselves by saying "We're
on the mend." Not so Mr. Parry, however.</p>

<p>"I consider," he says, "that the English
are naturally the most musical race in the
world, except the Germans. It would take
a good many pages to explain my opinion, as
it is obviously contrary to all the received and
accredited traditions, so I will not attempt to
justify it at present beyond saying that I don't
mean that the race is gifted with any natural
facility, but that taking it all round there is
more appreciation of what is genuinely and
wholesomely good&mdash;Beethoven, Bach, Haydn,
Brahms, Handel (at his best), Mozart,
and the great madrigalists and so forth&mdash;than
in any other country except Germany.
The fact that the English people have no
great taste for opera is all in their favour."</p>

<p>Mr. Parry concludes with a few remarks
on the merits and demerits of writing "to
order." "Certainly no one could turn out
anything worthy of the name of art," he says,
"if he had it on his mind that he was writing
under pressure; neither will any man do anything
really good when he is thinking more
of the money payment, or suiting managerial
ideas, than of the thorough working out of
his own devices. But this should not be
confounded with a man's undertaking work
that is thoroughly congenial to him when he
has plenty of time to carry it out honourably.
If the Philharmonic Society or Richter ask a
composer to write them a symphony, they
put at his disposal a magnificent orchestra for
the interpretation of anything that he may
have to say in that line; or if the committee
of any great festival invite a composer to
write them an oratorio several years before it
is wanted, they put at his disposal a splendid
chorus and soloists, and all the resources a
man can desire. With such opportunities, I
should have thought a man had a better
chance of being inspired to some purpose
than if he were pottering about just when the
humour took him."</p>

<p>I am fortunate enough to be able to give
here, in facsimile, a bar from the original
first score of "Job."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ebenezer Prout.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Prout, when composing, makes first a
very rapid sketch on two staves&mdash;with instrumental
works generally only the upper part
and a figured bass; with choruses, anthems,
etc., usually the four-voice parts. For songs
he writes only the melody, with just enough
indication of the accompaniment to prevent
his forgetting the idea.</p>

<p>"My first sketches," he says, "are always
written as fast as the pen will go. I make it
an invariable rule <i>never</i> to write unless I am
in the humour, and if I find that ideas do not
come as fast or faster than I can put them
down, if I have to stop to think what should
come next, I at once put the music-paper
aside, knowing that I am not in the mood
for composing. After completing my sketch I
begin the fair copy, the full score, in the case of
orchestral work, putting in the details and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
making considerable improvements. My
public works usually differ pretty widely from
the original draft; but the first sketch, containing
the fundamental idea, is invariably produced
at what I may call a 'white heat.'"</p>

<p>Composition, in this composer's opinion,
can be taught so far as the technique is concerned;
but if a student has no ideas, these
cannot be given by any instruction, though a
latent talent may often be brought out and
cultivated by proper training. By this he
means that there may be a natural aptitude for
composition of which its possessor is unaware
till his teacher discovers and develops it.</p>

<p>Of his own works Mr. Prout thinks he is,
perhaps, hardly an impartial judge, but his
own favourites are among the instrumental
work, his "3rd Symphony" and the two quartets
in B flat and F; and among the vocal
works, the cantatas the "Red Cross Knight"
and "Damon and Phintias."</p>

<p>"It is difficult," continues Mr. Prout, "to
give a definite opinion as to whether the
English are a musical nation; it depends so
much on the point of view. Judging by the
number of concerts, etc., we are musical
enough, but the want of general public
appreciation of the best class of music,
especially in the Metropolis, would incline me
to a far less favourable opinion. In this
respect I believe many parts of the provinces
are far ahead of London.</p>

<p>"Do I believe in writing 'to order'?
Well, I cannot speak for others, but for
myself, when I receive a commission to
write anything, I always accept, conditionally
on the spirit moving me. If the work I am
asked to undertake is sympathetic, the spirit
generally moves pretty soon. Some of my
best work has been commissioned, but to
write <i>merely for money</i> is repugnant to me. I
have never written a 'pot-boiler' in my life,
and, please God, I never will."</p>

<p>Mr. Prout concludes by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I usually compose in the evening, mostly
between six and ten, seldom later. If I have
a morning to spare, which does not often
happen except during my holidays, I
frequently find that a good time for composing.
Recently I have composed very
little, my time being too fully occupied with
writing the series of theoretical works, which
is still a long way from completion."</p>

<p>The MS. is taken from his well-known
"Piano Quartet in F."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rubinstein.</span></h3>

<p>From Herr Anton Rubinstein I have obtained
no information whatever. He has, however,
with the kindness which characterizes
him, sent me the accompanying MS.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/i_431b.jpg" width="636" height="286" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Theme et Variations op. 88</p>

<p>Ant. Rubinstein</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time ago Rubinstein left the St.
Petersburg Conservatoire, where he had
been for so many years, and visited
Dresden, in search of rest and quietness,
and laid aside all business for the time. For
any further information, I must refer my
readers to his "Autobiography," a fragment
published in America, and "A Conversation
Upon Music," published by Augner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">C. Saint-Sa&euml;ns.</span></h3>

<p>The French composer, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, considers
a piano a useless item in the art of
composition, at all events in his case,
for he rarely, if ever, makes use of one
when composing, even to play over completed
works.</p>

<p>Some MS. paper and a pencil are the only
materials he works with, and he has composed
whole operas without a musical
instrument in the house.</p>

<p>This manner of composing M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns
finds a great saving of valuable time
(and if composers' time is not important,
whose is?), and he does not consider that
ideas come any the more readily when seated
before a piano; in fact, rather the reverse.</p>

<p>The portion of MS. will be familiar to
those who have studied his works.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stanford.</span></h3>

<p>In Professor C. V. Stanford's opinion the
art of composition can be cultivated, but
never acquired. He composes according
to the mood in which he happens to
be, and never keeps to any fixed rule or
time.</p>

<p>As to composers working under pressure,
he imagines that must depend greatly upon
the temperament of the composer. He
expresses no opinion as to which he considers
his best work, but says: "That is for
the future to determine and individual tastes
to decide."</p>

<p>The half-dozen bars of music are taken
from his "Irish Symphony."</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strauss.</span></h3>

<p>Herr Johann Strauss, with whose dreamy
waltzes most of us are familiar, for his part
says that he is far too modest to designate
any composition as his <i>best</i>. When he finishes
one he forgets it completely for a time in the
interest caused by his next work. Method
he has none&mdash;only inspiration, genius&mdash;for
in his opinion composers can never be made.
"One may compose," he says, "very easily,
or&mdash;not at all." The divine art must be
innate, and a composer&mdash;like his brother
genius, the poet&mdash;must be born, and can
never be made. The music is taken from
one of his well-known waltzes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Berthold Tours.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Berthold Tours, who has written some
of the finest anthems and "Services" of the
present day, besides numerous songs, prefers
the morning for composition, and being an
early riser, is generally to be found hard at
work soon after 9 a.m., and seldom ceases
his labours till two o'clock. He never composes
at an instrument, and thinks that
people who do are very apt to get their ideas
from it and not out of their head; nor does
he force himself to compose, preferring to
wait till the inclination is upon him or the
composition on which he is engaged has
matured itself in his brain, when there only
remains the mechanical part of writing it
down, which very often takes up the most
time. If engaged upon a song, he first of all
reads his words over two or three times carefully
and thoughtfully, so as to obtain a grasp
of the style of the verses, and then the music
begins and the composition proceeds smoothly
to its close. Mr. Tours considers his "Service
in F" the best work
he has yet done. This
composition is a universal
favourite with
lovers of Church music,
and deservedly popular
at festivals.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to
hear that this composer
considers England a
musical nation. "Not
quite so great as Germany,
perhaps, but
during the last twenty
years there has been
great talent shown in music. We are
stronger now in clever composers than we
have ever been, and no nation is so appreciative
of good music as the English, or so
quick to recognise and encourage true genius."</p>

<p>Like Dr. A. C. Mackenzie, Mr. Tours
does not hold with the popular belief that
composers produce as fine works when
writing for commissions received as when
left to follow their own inclinations, but
acknowledges that many great works have
been thus produced.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Tours says that the
playing of good classical music, to those who
know the rules of writing, might be a very
great help, and would be an incentive to
good composition.</p>

<p>The portion of MS. is taken from his well-known
"Harvest Anthem."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">P. Tscha&iuml;kowsky.</span></h3>

<p>Klin, near Moscow, was the home of one
of the busiest of men. It is here that the
late Russian composer, Tscha&iuml;kowsky, lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
and worked, devoting the greater part of the
day to his art. Nine o'clock every morning
found him hard at work, and it was one
before he stopped for a light lunch. Two
hours every afternoon were rigidly set aside
for one of the few recreations in which he
used to indulge, viz., walking; and it was
during these daily strolls that most of the
sketches of his pieces were conceived, and
entered into a note-book which was always
forthcoming. Home was reached soon after
four, and from five to half-past eight was employed
in arranging and setting in order the
sketches jotted down during the walk.</p>

<p>A piano, he considered, is not absolutely
necessary, and he composed much without
the use of one. For instance, on a
journey, or long voyage, or when rusticating
in some primitive, far-away little
hamlet, where the peacefulness and quietude
are suggestive of composition, but where
the running brook does duty for a piano
and you fit your melodies to the
sighing of the wind among the fir trees.
Still, the instrument helped sometimes the
development of his musical ideas, and generally
when convenient he made use of one.
"I believe," he said, "the creating power of
music to be a precious gift of Nature, which
cannot be obtained by work and study, but
only improved and lighted by musical
sciences, besides being purely <i>emp&eacute;rique</i>.
With the belief that composers often work
better and produce finer results when put
under a certain amount of pressure the
professor agrees, pinning his belief on history,
which tells us of many masterpieces being
done thus.</p>

<p>"I have never thought," he resumed, "of
the reasons explaining why England, who
produced such great poets, has had,
comparatively speaking, but few musicians.
It seems to me that the idea that the English
are not gifted for music cannot be considered
as 'definitive.' Who knows that a
musical Shakespeare will not be produced?
You have already men of much promise and
whose work is very serious."</p>

<p>Of his own compositions, Tscha&iuml;kowsky
considered his opera "La Dame de Pique"
the best work he had ever done, an opinion
which is shared by many of his admirers.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_Zealous" id="THE_Zealous"><span class="smcap">THE Zealous
Sentinel</span></a></h2>

<h3>AN INCIDENT OF THE SIEGE OF
PARIS</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_435.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a chill and cheerless day
towards the end of November
of the year 1870. The siege
of Paris was in full tide of
determinate execution. For
two months, and a little more,
the German host had environed the city with
a circle of glistening bayonets and loud-mouthed
cannons, cutting off intercourse
with the outside world, and effectually preventing
the incoming of provisions; the
smoke and fumes of burning powder filled
the air; while shot and shell rained down
upon the doomed metropolis, by day and by
night.</p>

<p>Near the corner of the Boulevard Mazas
and the Rue de Bercy was situated the
wine-shop of Victor Rameau, a popular resort
of the middling classes, but patronized by
men of high standing, and often sought by
those of the lowest strata of society. On
this chill November day the spacious apartment
on the street level was filled by a
motley assemblage. There were present
representatives of almost every trade, profession,
and calling, though the military
element predominated.</p>

<p>At one of the small oaken tables against
the wall sat two men, with whom we have
particularly to do; and at the table next to
them, also against the wall, sat a third. Of
the two, one was a sergeant of the National
Guard, named Jacques Carlier, a middle-aged
man, with a heavy red moustache, and a
head of closely-clipped red hair. His face
was likewise very red, and his two eyes were
as nearly of the same fiery colour as they
could be.</p>

<p>The guardsman's companion was a short,
thick-set man, also of middle age, with dark
brown hair and a full beard of the same
colour. His stoutness was peculiar. It did
not seem to be fat, but an unusual size of
body and limb&mdash;somewhat as though in his
youth a ponderous weight had fallen upon
his head and shoulders and knocked him
into that squat, uncouth figure. His hair
was thick and tangled; his face, where the
full beard did not hide it, darkly tanned and
seemingly unwashed; and his clothing of the
very worst&mdash;worn and soiled and ragged.
He had given his name as Pierre Dubois,
claiming to be from Ardennes.</p>

<p>The third man&mdash;he at the other table&mdash;was
Colonel de Br&egrave;ze, of the National Guard.
Both he and the sergeant were in uniform,
and, saving only the rags, neither of them
could boast of a personal appearance very
much better than was that of the poor wayfarer
from Ardennes.</p>

<p>Pierre Dubois had dark lines under his
eyes; a look of pain and distress marked his
face; while a deep-reaching, rasping cough
ever and anon shook his frame and interrupted
his speech.</p>

<p>"I'd enlist this moment," he said, "if I
could be put on duty under cover, out of the
way of this miserable wintry wind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
what should I be good for in the trenches, or
at the breast-works? You can see for yourself
that I shouldn't last a week."</p>

<p>"Aye," returned the sergeant, "I see very
plainly that you wouldn't be good for much
in an exposed position. I should say consumption
was carrying you off about as fast
as it could."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;it&mdash;(a severe fit of coughing)&mdash;is."</p>

<p>"Are you fit to enlist at all?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; I do not suppose I am. But
I'll be frank with you. I have a spice of the
man Adam in me. It is Vengeance. I was
at Sedan, as I have told you, and the Germans
made me a prisoner. I wasn't fit to
march: I could hardly stand; so they pricked
me up with their sabre bayonets. Then,
when I was thrown into a dirty prison, and
begged for a bit of medicine for my cough,
they gave me curses and a kick. I swore
then, if ever the opportunity should be mine,
I would volunteer to stand sentinel over
a squad of German prisoners. You've got
those fellows in limbo, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, plenty of them."</p>

<p>"And you've got strong, able, well men
standing guard over them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have."</p>

<p>"Then, there's my opportunity. Put me
there, and I'll do double duty, if I can stand
it. At all events, I can perform the duties
of a sentinel just as well as any living
man."</p>

<p>At this point Colonel Br&egrave;ze, who had overheard,
faced about.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," he said, "we want this man.
I want him at La Force."</p>

<p>At the sound of the name of that celebrated
prison, a bright light gleamed in the provincial's
eyes, and he quickly hid his face
behind his beer-mug to conceal the emotion
he could not keep back.</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded, and then to the man
himself the colonel continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are used to military duty, my good
man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel. I was a conscript when I
was twenty, and served four years; and I
enlisted after that. I would be now with
Trochu, in all probability, had not the Germans
captured me at Sedan, when out on a
sortie, and held me until I escaped."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to get through
their lines when you entered our beleaguered
city?"</p>

<p>"They did not see me. I crawled in
through the rain, on a dark night."</p>

<p>"And you would like to do guard duty
over German prisoners, eh?"</p>

<p>"I could like nothing better. I have
prayed that the privilege might be mine."</p>

<p>"Very well, it shall be yours. I have
command of the guard of La Force. I want
you there."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i_436.jpg" width="356" height="587" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On that same November day&mdash;the day on
which we heard the conversation between the
colonel and the sergeant and the provincial&mdash;a
prisoner sat in one of the strongest and
most gloomy of the cells of La Force.
Most of the cells were occupied by several
persons, some of them containing as many
as could comfortably lie down therein; but
this man had been condemned to death,
and placed in solitary confinement. He was
a young man, not over thirty, fair-faced and
handsome. He was of German birth&mdash;a
German of Darmstadt&mdash;and though clad in
the garb of a French labourer, he was yet a
gentleman of education and refinement; his
name, as had been learned from marked
articles in his possession, Otho Maximilian.</p>

<p>Poor Maximilian! In his soldier's ardour
and love of country he had volunteered to
his Prince to enter the enemy's lines and
bring away a correct draught of the outer
and inner fortifications, together with proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
plans of the disposition of troops. And all
this he had come very near to doing; but,
alas! not quite. Had he been content to
carry away his observations and computations
in his head, and made the visible signs of his
espionage in the presence of his Prince, all
might have been well. He had gained the
interior of the city and its free range; he had
made plans of all important things he wished
to communicate, and he was apprehended
and searched, with those neatly drawn plans
upon his person.</p>

<p>Poor Otho! So young and so fair,
with wife and three children praying for
him, and waiting in the Fatherland, thus
to die! He shed no tears; he gave voice to
no complaints; he was sure his comrades
would keep his memory green;
that his Prince would bless him for
what he had tried to do, and that
his dearly loved ones would seek
consolation in the thought that he
had given his life to his country.</p>

<p>On the day after to-morrow he
was to die. He was not to be shot,
like a soldier, nor beheaded, as
kings and noblemen had been; he
was to suffer the ignominy of hanging.
The thought gave him keenest
torture.</p>

<p>That dismal day drew to a close,
and, at eventide, when the attendant
came with his food, he made one
last earnest appeal for writing
materials, that he might write a
brief letter to his wife. But such a
grant would be a violation of prison
law; it could not be done. Then
he closed his lips, resolved not to
speak again save to the Heavenly
Father.</p>

<p>The night passed, and another
dark and dismal day. Another
evening came, and another night
shut down over the great prison.
Otho's last night of earth, as the
few grim marks on his dungeon wall
told him.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock he threw himself
upon his hard straw pallet and
tried to sleep. He heard the solemn
bells strike the midnight hour, and
a few moments later the warder of
that corridor opened the little wicket
in his door and looked in upon him.</p>

<p>Had our prisoner been on the
outside of his cell at that particular time, he
would have seen a movement on the part of
the sentinel strange and unusual. This
sentinel had softly and noiselessly followed
the warder to that door, had stood very
near while he looked in at the wicket,
and then, when he had started on to the
next cell, he leaped upon him as a
cat would strike its prey. A single blow
of a sand-bag upon the warder's head felled
him to the granite pavement as though a
lightning-bolt had smitten him. On the
next instant the sentinel was upon his knees,
those knees upon the fallen man's breast,
with a folded napkin, in which was a broad,
flat, fine sponge, pressed tightly over the
mouth and nostrils. A brief space so, then
the guardsman took from his breast pocket a
small flask and renewed the chloroform in
the sponge.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i_437.jpg" width="372" height="594" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A SPONGE PRESSED TIGHTLY OVER THE MOUTH."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Otho Maximilian had heard the opening of
the wicket, and had seen the face that had
peered in upon him. He had again closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
his eyes, when he heard a dull, heavy thud,
as though a ponderous body had fallen upon
the adamantine floor. The sound was so
unusual, so strange and unaccountable, that
he was startled&mdash;not with fear, but with a
nameless, shapeless spectre of the unseen.
He arose and bent his ear attentively.</p>

<p>Ere long he heard the light clatter of a
key as it was inserted into the lock of his
door, and presently the door was opened and
a man came in&mdash;a man habited in the
uniform of the National Guard.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Sh!" whispered the guardsman.
"Speak not, but do as I bid you. Throw
off that ragged blouse. Sacr&eacute;!&mdash;will you
obey? Bah!&mdash;it is a friend! Now act, and
quickly!"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;you?&mdash;Mar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you stop your tongue and obey?
We will talk by-and-by."</p>

<p>Without another word the prisoner pulled
off his blouse and threw it aside. At the
same time the guardsman stripped off his
uniform, threw off waist-belt and baldric, with
the sword; then
the coat with its
gaudy facings;
then the pants,
gaiters, and the
shoes; and he
bade the other to
get himself into
them with all possible
dispatch,
which was done.</p>

<p>And yet the
guardsman stood
in full uniform as
before. He had
come doubly clad,
even to the hat
and an extra
pompon. And
there was still
another dress inside
the uniform
in which he now
appeared. No
wonder he had
looked strangely
rotund and squat
when we met him
in M. Rameau's
wine-shop.</p>

<p>"Come! Look
out that your
sword does not
clank, yet be ready to use it if need be.
Now follow me. Look neither to the right
nor to the left. Are you ready? So!
Forward! March!"</p>

<p>As they passed out upon the corridor,
closing the door behind them, Otho saw the
warder prone upon the pavement, and his
sensitive olfactories detected the presence of
the powerful an&aelig;sthetic that held him in
thrall.</p>

<p>On that corridor they were at liberty to
move as they pleased&mdash;for though there was
a post of observation commanding that whole
floor, yet the officer whose duty it was to
occupy it was the warder who now lay senseless,
and whose keys the sentinel had taken
into his own possession.</p>

<p>"Mark you," whispered the liberator, when
they had reached the head of the stairs and
were about to descend, "we have our greatest
risk directly ahead. The sentinels below
have just come on, and may not be wakeful
enough to be over-inquisitive. We must
make them believe that we have been
relieved, and that we stopped behind to help
M. Joubert examine a cell."</p>

<img src="images/i_438.jpg" width="572" height="577" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE READ THE PASS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Will they not know at once
that I am not a true National
Guardsman?" asked Otho.</p>

<p>"Not if you hide your face as
best as you can. They know not me. I
came on last evening for the first time. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
only entered the service yesterday; enlisted
on purpose for this bit of work. Oh, God,
send that it prove a success! Now, forward!
march!"</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs was a door, which
the zealous sentinel unlocked with a key
taken from the pocket of the warder. As
they were ready to step forth, he called out,
imitating the gruff tones of the warder as
closely as possible:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There&mdash;off you go! and I thank you for
your help!"</p>

<p>"You are entirely welcome; but you've
robbed me of nigh half an hour's sleep, nevertheless;
good-night, M. Joubert."</p>

<p>The last words were upon his lips as he
stepped forth into the lower hall, and the
sentinel there standing supposed, naturally
enough, that he was addressing the warder of
the above.</p>

<p>"Now, comrade," said our experimenting
guardsman, to the sentinel there stationed,
"if you will let us out, we shall be grateful.
M. Joubert has kept us to help him care for
a prisoner who was inclined to be restive."</p>

<p>"Certainly, comrade." And, without hesitation,
the honest sentinel ushered the twain
forth into the vestibule, whence they made
way to the open court.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, mark me once more: I
am Pierre Dubois; you are Julien Bizet&mdash;both
of the National Guard. I have in my
pocket a pass, signed by Colonel de Br&egrave;ze&mdash;or
it will answer for his signature. I think
this will set us free. Come!"</p>

<p>Boldly they entered the office of the
night keeper,
where Pierre exhibited
his pass.
Fortune favoured
the adventurers at
every turn. This
keeper was a plethoric,
heavy-eyed
man, dull and
sleepy. He read the
pass and gave it
back, and, with only
a grunt and a growl
at being disturbed,
he got up and
opened the way for
the anxious twain
to go free.</p>

<p>In the uniform of
the National Guard,
and with the pass of
Colonel Br&egrave;ze, it was
an easy matter for
the fugitives to make their way to the outer
fortifications, whence they had no difficulty in
slipping through into the German lines,
where they were received with great rejoicing.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1875-76, Colonel
Alphonse de Br&egrave;ze was called, by business of
State, to the Prussian capital, and while there
he went to the theatre. The play advertised
on the occasion of his first visit was called
"The Guardsman," the leading character of
which was a rollicking, fun-making soldier of
the French National Guard, said character
being enacted by a Berlin favourite, Martin
&#338;sau. When the guardsman made his
appearance on the stage, De Br&egrave;ze was
electrified. With the first effort of thought
he recognised the man&mdash;his recruit of
Rameau's wine-shop!&mdash;his zealous sentinel of
La Force!&mdash;his Pierre Dubois!</p>

<p>De Br&egrave;ze could honour and respect brave
men. A few days later he called upon
M. &#338;sau at his home, and spent a pleasant
hour; and not long thereafter he met Otho
Maximilian at the same place.</p>

<p>"My friends," the colonel said, as he put
down his empty wine-glass, "had you seen
and heard me on that November morning, five
years ago, when my prisoner was demanded
of me, and I found an empty cell and a
sentinel missing, you would have been slow
to believe that an event like this could ever
enter into the story of our lives!"</p>

<p>"Thank high Heaven for peace and for
friendship!" was &#338;sau's fervent response.</p>

<p>And they filled up and emptied their
glasses to the sentiment.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE UNBELIEVERS' CLUB.</p></div>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_440.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> had been silence for
twenty minutes in the circle of
our weekly convivial at the
"Chain-Harve." The last word
had been "ghosts"&mdash;or, more
accurately, "ghostes." During
that twenty minutes' silence, broken only by
the puffing of pipes and the setting down of
mugs, Mr. Coffin (who had been an undertaker,
or something of that sort, up at London,
and was considered the leading mind of the
convivial club) had sat twinkling his eyes at
the kettle-crane in a way that told those who
knew him that something was to come out
presently. At the end of the twenty minutes
Peter broke the silence with:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He, he! Ghostes! Them's things as
some folks thinks as ther' mebbe more in
'em ner is gen'ly thought&mdash;more'n wot some
other folks thinks!"</p>

<p>Mr. Coffin transferred his twinkle to Peter,
and then spread it over the company. But
the company were engaged in twinkling
for themselves&mdash;or, rather, in blinking
(which was their substitute for twinkling)&mdash;at
the kettle-crane. Most of them
were wagging their heads very slowly from
side to side.</p>

<p>"There's some as don't believe nothink,"
said old Billet.</p>

<p>"An' 'ow about Mrs. Skindle and them
there lights down in the Low Medder?" said
Peter.</p>

<p>"And 'ow about Master George's groom?"
said Mr. Armstrong, of the Mill.</p>

<p>"Ar!" murmured the company.</p>

<p>Mr. Coffin had now completed the spreading
of his twinkle over the company, and
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me, gentlemen, that this club
has a sort of duty in this very matter of
ghosts and things. There's a great deal too
much ignorance and superstition about."</p>

<p>The company, added to by the dropping in
of occasional new arrivals, transferred their
gaze&mdash;no longer a blink&mdash;to Mr. Coffin, in
feeble surprise. Then, very gradually, the
slow wag of the heads dissolved into a slow
nod; as they said, very thoughtfully, "Ar!"</p>

<p>"It isn't only ghosts," continued Mr.
Coffin. "It's superstition generally that it's
our duty to put our foot down against.
There's all sorts of nonsense about ill-luck
from going under ladders, and spilling salt,
and crossing knives&mdash;it's a sheer disgrace to
the century!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ar!" said the company, feebly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you agree with me," went on
Mr. Coffin, "because I've always felt strongly
about the foolishness of these superstitions.
Now, I was reading the other day in the paper
about a club they have in London&mdash;it was
there in my time, too; but that brought it
to my mind. That club was established to
ridicule those very superstitions; and they go
at it with a vengeance when they are at it&mdash;regularly
perspire over it, you might say.
Well, now&mdash;why shouldn't we&mdash;this club&mdash;take
up this matter too, just to show the
people round about how sensible we are&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Ar!" said the company.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, we couldn't have a more
suitable occasion to inaugurate the new proceedings
than to-night. This is Hallowe'en,
gentlemen, the one night of the year
on which people have the best chance of
seeing ghosts&mdash;witches' night, you know;
and what's more, there are just thirteen
of us present, and that's another lucky
thing; and what's more, Mr. Puter's yard
dog has been howling all the evening, which
is supposed to be a sign that somebody in
this house will die
shortly; and, by the
way, I heard the death-watch
most distinctly
ticking in your parlour
wall when I came in
to-day, Peter; so, if
you're as eager about
the subject as I feel
sure you are, why,
there's no reason why
we shouldn't begin at
once."</p>

<p>"Why not?" murmured
the company,
very low and hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;those
who are in favour
of the new departure
will indicate the same
in the usual manner,
by holding up their
hands," said Mr. Coffin.</p>

<p>And he turned his
eye on each of the
company in turn, and
as he did so, the one
gazed at feebly held
up his hand, and then
dropped it as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>They had failed to
notice, before he pointed it out, that they
numbered just thirteen. The attendance at
the club varied from time to time, owing to
some of the frequenters living in neighbouring
villages, and to other reasons.</p>

<p>So Mr. Coffin called for two knives and a
salt-cellar; and then each one present was
blindfolded in turn and made to go through
a ceremony of initiation over the crossed
knives and to spill some salt; after which
Mr. Coffin entertained them with a discourse
about ghosts, rising gravestones, banshees,
corpse lights, and other things which it was
the duty of the new club to ridicule.</p>

<p>"The time is approaching when the landlord
will request us to leave the premises,"
said Mr. Coffin; "and, as you are aware, the
first of us to rise to depart must, according to
the superstition, die within the year: a most
laughable superstition, of course!"</p>

<p>Mr. Coffin looked round. Each one whom
he fixed with his eye chuckled feebly and
whispered "Ar&mdash;o' course!"</p>

<p>"Who volunteers to rise first?" asked Mr.
Coffin, fixing his twinkle on the kettle-crane.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i_441.jpg" width="312" height="587" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"TIME, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>There was a dead silence, broken by a
low, blood-curdling,
tremulous moan from
the yard; a moan
which swelled into a
howl so prolonged that
it seemed as though it
would never cease.
Then another dead
silence, broken by a
dreadful grating death-cry
from the woods;
only the cry of the
screech-owl. Then the
landlord looked in and
said: "Time, gentlemen,
please."</p>

<p>But no one stirred;
Mr. Coffin's twinkle
was still fixed upon the
crane.</p>

<p>"I propose, brother
Unbelievers," he said,
"that Peter, as being
the person in whose
house the death-watch
is ticking at present, is
the fittest person to
rise. This will give
him a great opportunity
of showing his contempt
for absurd superstitions."</p>

<p>"That's right, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>how&mdash;'ear!
'ear!" said the other eleven,
quite heartily this time; and Peter desperately
seized and emptied his glass of gin and
water, and&mdash;pale as a sheet&mdash;slowly rose and
buttoned his coat. As he did so, there
resounded again, simultaneously, the howl of
the yard dog and the death-cry of the screech-owl.
Peter grinned a ghastly grin, wiped
his brow, said tremulously, "Well&mdash;goo'
night," and crawled out.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Coffin removed his twinkle once
more from the crane, and rose, and beamed
round upon the company.</p>

<p>"This <i>is</i> a magnificent opportunity for
the display of our contempt for superstition!"
he exclaimed, enthusiastically. "If
I remember rightly, it was on a Hallowe'en,
just seven years ago, that the tramp
hanged himself to that oak at the turn of the
road&mdash;your way home, by the way, Mr.
Armstrong. Yes, it <i>was</i> Hallowe'en! How
fortunate! And then there's Master George's
groom who was thrown and broke his neck
at the Squire's gate, and is said to haunt the
avenue just inside so as to be seen from the
road. Why, if he's to be seen <i>any</i> night,
he's safe to be about on Hallowe'en&mdash;and
that's on <i>your</i> road home, Mr. Billet; there's
a chance for <i>you</i>! Then some of you
have to cross the Low
Meadow where old
Meg was drowned, in
the time of William
the Fourth, and where
the corpse-lights are to
be seen, eh? Why,
there's some fun for
every one of you.
There's the churchyard,
too, with a lot of
queer stories about it.
Don't you remember
about Joe Watts seeing
that grey thing sitting
on the grave that had
been opened, no one
knew how?</p>

<p>"Capital! I'll tell
you what. Just come
into my place and
finish the evening, and
then you can all start
off in time to pass those
places exactly at midnight.
Come along;
and I'll start you all
off at the right time."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/i_442.jpg" width="582" height="555" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SPRANG OUT UPON PERSONS PASSING BY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Getting skilfully
behind them all&mdash;(for
Peter had been found hanging about just
outside the door of the "Chain-Harve")&mdash;he
edged them into his cottage like a
collie showing sheep into a pen; and made
them all sit down; and told them about an
uncle of his who had gone by a haunted spot
for all the world like the turn of the road
where the tragedy of the tramp had occurred;
and had heard something following him,
though he could see nothing; and had felt a
feeling like a dead fish sliding down his
back; and had been unable to stir from the
spot or to turn his head, although he
felt a something behind him all the time;
and had been found nearly dead in the
morning. Then there was another tale of a
maniac with blood on his nails, who lurked
behind headstones in just such a churchyard
as the one some of them had to pass through
that night, and sprang out upon persons passing
by; and was felt to be cold and slimy;
and left those whom he touched paralyzed all
down one side. And there was the story of
the woman who saw a gravestone slowly
rising&mdash;rising&mdash;rising of its own accord; and
several other stories. Between the stories, in
the dead silences, were heard the howls of the
yard dog and the cries of the screech-owl: for
Mr. Coffin lived close to the "Chain-Harve."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now it's about time for some of you
to be off," he said, rising. "You shall go
one by one. Your road home lies by the
Low Meadow, Peter; you'd better start now,
and you'll just get there as the clock strikes
twelve&mdash;you'll hear the church clock down
there, so you can hang about a bit if you get
there too soon. Good-night! Bless me,
look at that thing in the elm tree! Doesn't
it look like a man hanging there? Oh, of
course, that's the light from my window on
the leaves. Well, good-night, good-night all!
Don't forget the rising gravestones, and the
maniac, and the groom, and the dead fish!"</p>

<p>When the last of them had got round the
turn in the road, Mr. Coffin put on his coat
and crept out after them, walking on the turf
at the side of the road so that his steps could
not be heard. Presently he made a short
cut across Farmer Worripp's third field so as
to head them. At the other end of the field
was the tramp's corner, with the fatal tree,
now thin as to leaves, standing out blurrily
against the dark sky. There, behind the
hedge, Mr. Coffin waited to observe how Mr.
Armstrong would pass the spot; Armstrong
had been started off in good time to
pass the spot a little before twelve; but the
watcher waited in vain&mdash;no Armstrong turned
up. So Mr. Coffin started off again, across
country, toward the churchyard, arriving there
just before twelve, and hiding behind King
John's Yew; he strained his ear for the
sound of feet, but no sound of feet was to
be heard. No one going by the road could
possibly have arrived there before him.
The clock struck twelve, but no one
came; he waited until the quarter-past&mdash;still
no one came. Then he started off, still
across country, to a point on Peter's way
home, some three-quarters of a mile beyond
the Low Meadow&mdash;but no Peter was to be
seen. So Mr. Coffin went home across the
Low Meadow without meeting a soul&mdash;or a
spirit. Even down at the Low Meadow he
could hear the distant howl of the yard dog&mdash;a
marrow-chilling sound enough; but Mr.
Coffin had absolutely no nerves, and simply
chuckled.</p>

<p>How the members of the Unbelievers'
Club got home that night nobody ever knew
except themselves; but next morning Mr.
Coffin was on his pony making the round of
their dwelling or working places, and interviewing
them.</p>

<p>But they seemed very grumpy and short
that morning (one and all): and on his ride
home Mr. Coffin twinkled so at the hedges
and the trees and the sky, and chuckled so
incessantly that even his pony (who was
used to his ways) several times stopped
and turned a brown eye round at its
rider in surprise and inquiry. All that day
twelve out of the thirteen members of the
Unbelievers' Club were morose and out of
humour; and that evening the majority of
them happened to drop in at the "Threshing
Machine," at the other end of the district
from the "Chain-Harve." They said very
little beyond "Good evening," and sat in the
tap-room looking sheepishly at the fire, the
important subject of the newly-established
club being strangely avoided.</p>

<p>But reports of the prowess of the club on
the previous night had been carefully spread
by Mr. Coffin. He had told everybody he
came across how Armstrong had sat and
smoked right under the tramp's tree while the
clock struck twelve, and how Billet had spent
nearly an hour by the gate of the Squire's
park, challenging the groom's ghost to show
up, and making the avenue echo with his
laughter; and so forth: so that the members
of the new club had become heroes. Thus,
one by one, the villagers were attracted to
drop in at the "Threshing Machine" to gaze
reverentially at the fearless ghost-defiers, and
ask them all about it.</p>

<p>"It must hav' give yer a bit of a creepy
feelin' when the clock began to strike?"
said the saddler.</p>

<p>"Me? Golong with yer! 'Ope <i>I</i> ain't sech
a turnip-liver as ter be frightened at bogies!"
replied Armstrong, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yur! D'ye take us for a set o' babies?"
asked Billet, witheringly.</p>

<p>"Yah!" exclaimed Joe Murzle. "Wot
next?"</p>

<p>Then the admirers stood drinks to the
heroes; and by the time the latter got up&mdash;with
more or less difficulty&mdash;to go home,
there wasn't one among them who would not
have given a week's earnings to meet the
most creepy ghost about.</p>

<p>But the next morning they were silent
once more; and Peter looked gloomily over
the fence at Billet.</p>

<p>"Mighty queer about this 'ere pig o' mine,
<i>that's</i> wot it is!" said he. "Bin ailing, he
has, ever since yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Billet. "We-el&mdash;if you
ask <i>me</i>&mdash;I tell yer plain as I do b'leeve my
roomatics come on wuss night afore last, and
that's pat."</p>

<p>Then they were silent, shaking their heads
for several minutes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer," said Peter. "'Umbug it
may be; an' truck it may be; but there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
things as is best let alone, and that I <i>do</i> think.
Thur ain't no kind o' weak-mindyness nor
credibility about <i>me</i>; but I says, wot's the
objeck o' goin' a-spillin' o' salt, an' crossin'
knives, an' settin' down thirteen?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/i_444.jpg" width="573" height="439" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"MIGHTY QUEER ABOUT THIS 'ERE PIG O' MINE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Ar!" said Billet, eagerly, "that's wot I
ses&mdash;let sleepin' dogs lie, ses I; and then
yer won't git bitten, I ses!"</p>

<p>"I've got a kind o' notion as things are
a-going somehow queerish like," said Armstrong,
passing along the lane at that
moment. "Do me if I can git the wind right
way round into the mill-sails this mornin' nor
yet yesterday; and what on earth shed make
that there lot o' flour mouldy&mdash;well! That
there pig's tail o' yourn don't look kind o'
right&mdash;it's a-hangin' out straight as a dip.
Wot's ailin'?"</p>

<p>Peter and Billet looked at each other and
shook their heads. Then Joe Maydew came
along, and told how he had his doubts about
them turkeys of his being quite as they should
be, and how Jem Baker the carrier's horse
had gone lame the day before; and how other
suspicious things were happening.</p>

<p>Now, as a fact, Peter's pig had been ailing
over a week, and the mill had been refractory
for five or six days&mdash;ever since the wind had
been so choppy; and Baker's horse had
gradually gone lame from a shoe-nail badly
driven ten days previously. But the "Club"
had not been nervously looking out for evil
signs until some thirty hours ago, and so had
failed to find any particular significance in the
mishaps.</p>

<p>"It strikes <i>me</i>," said Maydew (one of the
Unbelievers' Club), "that there's folks as is
fools and folks as is bigger fools; and these
'ere last kind is them as must go a-sneerin',
and unb'leevin', and defyin', and temptin' o'
Providence. Wot's Providence provide bad
luck for, if you ain't free to 'elp yerself to it?
An' how are yer goin' to 'elp yerself to it if
ther' ain't no proper reckernized means o'
doing of it&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>"Do jest seem like throwin' away the gifts
o' Providence, don't it?" said Peter.</p>

<p>"And wot I ses, them as up and persuades
others for to do that same, though bein'
nameless, is got to answer to it," said Billet.
"There's things as we knows about, and
there's other things, as contrariwise, we don't;
and when you ses unluck, and ghostes, and
sech &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"All tomfoolery, aren't they, Mr. Billet?
and no one's more convinced of that than
you and Peter," put in Mr. Coffin, who had
come along unobserved, fixing his persuasive
eye on Billet.</p>

<p>The influence of Mr. Coffin's eye was
remarkable: poor Billet and Peter stood on
one foot and then on the other, and grinned
feebly, while the other two stood scratching
their chins; and, with a cheery wave of the
hand, Mr. Coffin passed on; and when he
was out of sight those four stuck their fists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
defiantly into the very bottoms of their
pockets, and put their legs wide apart, and
muttered: "Is got to arnswer for it; and
it's a mercy if there ain't bad luck for <i>them</i>."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"HE SET FIRE TO HIS THATCH."</p></div>
</div>

<p>For the rest of that week the Unbelievers
spent their time in detecting signs of the ill-luck
brought upon them by the rash proceedings
of that fatal evening; for, in truth, they
were as superstitious a set as one could well
find. By the end of the week a thousand
small misfortunes had happened, exactly on
a footing with the
small misfortunes
which had been
happening to them
every week of their
lives; but <i>now</i> these
desperate deeds at
the "Chain-Harve"
caused everything.</p>

<p>Peter's pig got so
ill that Peter was
forced to sell it at
less than quarter
value to the local
butcher, who was
forced to send the
carcass to London to
dispose of it; and
then Peter&mdash;always
feeble-minded&mdash;began
to grow moody
and to stand about
brooding on ills to
come; and while he
stood brooding with
a candle in his hand
he set fire to his
thatch and burned
off half his roof.</p>

<p>Then the evening
came round for the
weekly meeting of
the "Unbelievers'
Club," and Mr.
Coffin sat in state in
the club-room chair
at the "Chain-Harve";
but at half-past
seven (the regulation time for dropping
in) not a member appeared, nor until a quarter
past eight; and then Mr. Coffin set off for the
other end of the parish, and found them all
at the "Threshing Machine."</p>

<p>"Ha! Good evening, gentlemen!" said
he, taking a big chair by the fire. "So you've
decided to hold our club meeting here for a
change?"</p>

<p>"'Ear! 'ear!" cried all those who were
not of the fated twelve. Then came a ten
minutes' silence. Then Armstrong said,
doggedly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to clubs, there's clubs as is all right;
and there's clubs as is, what you might say,
otherwise&mdash;an' that's all about it!"</p>

<p>"Ar! That's jest where it is!" said old
Billet.</p>

<p>"An' take it or leave it!" added Joe Maydew.</p>

<p>"Ar!" said the rest.</p>

<p>Peter sat in a
dark corner, behind
a string of onions,
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"Is it your pleasure,
fellow Unbelievers,
that we
go into committee
on the future programme
of the
club?" asked Mr.
Coffin.</p>

<p>"'Ear! 'ear!"
cried the curious
non-members,
eagerly.</p>

<p>But Armstrong
rose and stuck his
fists again into the
bottoms of his
pockets, and glared
at the proposer.</p>

<p>"W'y, if it comes
to that, no, it ain't!"
he said, fiercely.
"And take it out o'
that!" And with
that he stamped out
of the "Threshing
Machine," followed
by Joe Maydew.</p>

<p>The non-members
were terribly disappointed;
Mr. Coffin's influence
was powerless to set
the proceedings
going; the affair was
a disastrous frost; and presently the party
broke up. At the hour for closing Peter
still sat in the dark corner behind the
string of onions, rocking his chair on its two
hind legs and glowering at his boots; and
he had to be nudged three times before he
started up and mechanically trudged out,
with his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>Next day, at the time for going to work,
Peter sat in his living-room with his chin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
upon his chest, and refused to budge. He
had not attempted to repair the thatch of his
roof; and the rain had soaked his bed, and
spoilt his one or two books, and the coloured
prints on his wall and other things; but he
merely gazed hopelessly round like one under
an irremovable curse, and gave it up. He
had left the cover off his little flour-tub, and
the rain had soaked the flour, and a hen was
scratching in it; but there he sat and
glowered.</p>

<p>Then he lost his employment at Farmer
Worripp's, for the farmer could not wait his
pleasure, and had to engage another hand
instead; and so Peter had to go to the
"house" for out-door relief. So he dragged
on, wandering round his garden patch, with
his head low, and glowering, and brooding,
and waiting for the further developments of
the ill-luck he had brought on himself by
the proceedings at the "Club."</p>

<p>Then his landlord grew tired of receiving
no rent, and Peter had to leave his cottage,
after selling his few "sticks" to his neighbours;
or, rather, after his neighbours had
come forward and given him a trifle for this
and that article, which he would otherwise
have left behind without an attempt to sell.</p>

<p>And so he wandered out into the road,
quietly, at dusk, when no one was observing,
and stood for a moment at his gate, wavering
which way to go; and then he turned at the
sound of a dog barking, and went off slowly
in the direction to which he had turned, with
no pack&mdash;nothing but his clothes and the
small amount from the sale in his pocket.</p>

<p>As he passed the "Chain-Harve," his head
still on his breast, Mr. Coffin (who had been
away for ten days, and had not heard of
Peter's latest straits) was standing in the doorway
and caught sight of him.</p>

<p>"Halloa, Master Peter," said Coffin.
"Whither away now? Coming in to have
half-a-pint?"</p>

<p>Peter suddenly stopped in the light from
the tap-room window, raised his head, and
glared fiercely at the speaker: then spat on
the ground before him, and disappeared into
the darkness.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Mr. Coffin heard
all about Peter's recent troubles, he set off
along the road the way he had gone, and
searched for him high and low. Peter had
been seen in the next village, and had bought
a loaf and some cheese at the grocer's; but
beyond this the seeker could not trace him.
He tried the next day, and the next; but
with no success.</p>

<p>It was eight or nine weeks after this that,
at sunset, Peter dragged himself from under
a haystack where he had been asleep, and
drew himself slowly up to a standing position.
He was scarcely recognisable: his
unwashed face was seared and lined with
exposure, misery, and incessant brooding on
the ill-luck which had long ago developed
in his feeble mind into a crushing curse&mdash;a
curse deliberately brought down upon himself
by some awful and inexpiable blasphemy&mdash;for
such was the phantasy which had
evolved itself out of those harmless acts of
spilling the salt and so forth at the inauguration
of the Unbelievers' Club. Day and
night&mdash;until he had fallen down with sheer
inability to keep awake&mdash;he had wandered
on, with his chin on his chest and his eyes
on the road, brooding over the "blasphemy"
and the "curse." He looked like a skeleton;
his eyes had grey hollows all round; his
clothes were in rags; and he had been wet
through for many days.</p>

<p>Suddenly, now, he glared at the setting
sun; then sprang forward to a heap of flints
on the roadside, and with trembling hand
eagerly selected a large stone, and hugged it
up inside the breast of his coat. Then he
set off hurriedly&mdash;almost at a run&mdash;along the
road; and walked, walked, at the same pace,
into the dusk, into the darkness, under the
stars. Now and again he would take out
the flint and feel it caressingly; and once
he suddenly stopped, and tore off a large
piece of his coat, and wrapped the stone
in it; and tied his old red handkerchief over
that, and put the stone back in his coat.
Stumbling along at the same pace, he arrived
about ten o'clock at the window of the
"Threshing Machine," and peered in; everyone
was away that night at a merrymaking
in the next village, and Mr. Coffin sat alone
in the tap-room.</p>

<p>Peter pushed open the tap-room door, and
suddenly appeared before Mr. Coffin, who
started up in surprise. After a few moments'
scrutiny he recognised the changed figure,
and advanced and touched its arm, and sat it
down in a chair; and went out and returned
with some bread and cheese and a mug of ale.</p>

<p>Peter pushed away the food and swallowed
the pint of ale at a gulp, then held out the
mug to be refilled. It was strong ale, not
"swipes." Mr. Coffin took the mug and set
it down; and while his back was turned
Peter seized his untouched glass of hot rum
and water and swallowed the liquor.</p>

<p>Not once did Peter speak, even in reply;
but each time the other turned his back, he
would bring out the flint in its wrappings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
caress it, and glare at Mr. Coffin. Then
suddenly Peter sprang up and tottered out;
and Mr. Coffin, after a vain attempt to find
him in the darkness outside, mounted his
pony and set off for home. He took the
lane for the Low Meadow; and after him,
keeping on the grass or in the soft mud,
crept Peter, caressing the flint stone.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Coffin did not return home that night,
although his pony did; and the next day he
was found on the Low Meadow with his skull
fractured and a large sharp flint lying close
by; and Peter was found lying face upwards,
glaring at the sky through three feet of water,
at the spot where tradition said that old Meg
was drowned in the time of William the
Fourth.</p>

<p>The Low Meadow is triply haunted now;
and the villagers avoid it after nightfall
more carefully than ever. The Unbelievers'
Club exists no longer.</p>
